<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3 id="THE_AENEID"><span class="smcap">The Æneid</span></h3>

<p>When Rome, torn and bleeding from a century of civil
wars, turned to that wise judge of men, the second Cæsar,
and acquiesced as, through carefully selected ministers,
he gathered the reins of power into velvet-clad fingers of
steel, she did wisely. Better one-man power than anarchy!
It became the part of true patriotism for the citizen
and of statesmanship for the politician to bring to the
aid of the First Man of the state all the motives that could
harmonize the chaotic elements, and start Republican
Rome on the path of a new unity—the unity of the Empire.</p>

<p>For already “far away on the wide Roman marches
might be heard, as it were, the endless, ceaseless monotone
of beating horses’ hoofs and marching feet of men. They
were coming, they were nearing, <i>like footsteps heard on
wool</i>;<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> there was a sound of multitudes and millions of
barbarians, all the North, mustering and marshalling her
peoples.” In his great task Augustus, with the aid of
Mæcenas, very cleverly drew to his help writers whose
work has since charmed the world. We can almost pardon
fate for destroying the Republic—it gave us Virgil and
Horace.</p>

<p>Pleasant indeed had it been for Virgil to sing in emulation
of his great teacher Lucretius! “As for me,” he
says, “first of all I would pray that the charming Muses,
whose minister I am, for the great love that has smitten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
me, would receive me graciously, and teach me the courses
of the stars in heaven, the various eclipses of the sun and
the earth, what is the force by which the deep seas swell
to the bursting of their barriers and settle down again on
themselves—why the winter suns make such haste to
dip in ocean, or what is the retarding cause which makes
the nights move slowly.” Pleasant, too, to spend his
“chosen coin of fancy flashing out from many a golden
phrase” in picturing “the liberty of broad domains,
grottos and natural lakes, cool Tempe-like valleys, lawns
and dens where wild beasts hide, a youth strong to labor
and inured to scanty fare.” “Let me delight in the country
and the streams that freshen the valleys—let me love
river and woodland with an unambitious love.” “Then,
too, there are the husbandman’s sweet children ever hanging
on his lips—his virtuous household keeps the tradition
of purity.” Ah, yes, to Virgil most attractive was the
simple life of the lover of nature, and charmingly did he
portray it in his <i>Eclogues</i> and <i>Georgics</i>!</p>

<p>But Augustus, recognizing the genius of Virgil, and
realizing the supreme need of a reinvigorated patriotism,
urgently demanded an epic that should portray Rome’s
beginnings and her significance to the world. Reluctantly
then Virgil took up this task. Even at his death he considered
it unfulfilled. Indeed it was his wish that the
manuscript be destroyed. Almost immediately the <i>Æneid</i>
became the object of the closest study, and ever since it
has evoked the deepest admiration. Perhaps no other
secular writing has so profoundly affected literature.</p>

<h3 id="VIRGILS_LIFE"><span class="smcap">Virgil’s Life</span></h3>

<p>Virgil (Publius Vergilius Maro), born in the rural district
near Mantua, a farmer’s son, was given by his loving
father a careful education. Of his father Virgil says,
“those whom I have ever loved and above all my father.”
The regard of his hero Æneas for his father Anchises not
merely illustrates the early Roman filial affection—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
suggests Virgil’s relation to his own parent. In north
Italy Virgil studied at Mantua, Cremona, and Milan, and
at seventeen took up his wider studies at Rome itself in
the year 53 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> Catullus had died the year before,
Lucretius was dead two years. At Rome Virgil had the
best masters in Greek, rhetoric, and in philosophy, a study
in which he especially delighted. In forming his own
poetic style Virgil was profoundly influenced by Lucretius,
whose great poem <i>On Nature</i> treated of the wondrous
physical universe, and by the subtly sweet young Catullus,</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In such studies Virgil spent ten years. But in 41 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
he appears again in north Italy and this time in storm and
stress. In the year of Philippi the triumvirs, settling
their victorious legions, confiscated lands about Cremona,
and Virgil, attempting to resist dispossession, came near
to losing his life. Through fellow-students of the Roman
days he secured an introduction to Octavius and was
compensated—either recovering his own farm, or receiving
in lieu of it an estate in Campania.</p>

<p>Virgil relates his experience in two of his ten <i>Eclogues</i>
which were published in their present form in 38 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>
These charming poems were especially loved by Milton
and Wordsworth. Macaulay indeed considered them the
best of Virgil’s works. At Rome they met immediate
success with the people and with Octavius and his wise
minister Mæcenas, Horace’s patron. In them Virgil
tenderly sings love of friends, home, and country.</p>

<p>Then Virgil spent seven years on the four books of the
<i>Georgics</i>, publishing them in 29 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, two years after
Actium. The <i>Georgics</i> Merivale calls “the glorification
of labor.” In them Virgil hymns the farmer’s life in
beautiful Italy.</p>

<p>“Hail to thee, land of Saturn, mighty mother of noble
fruits and noble men! For thee I essay the theme of
the glory and the skill of olden days.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span></p>

<p>Virgil was now acknowledged the greatest poet of Italy.
In the year 26 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>, one year after the title Augustus had
been conferred on Octavius, we find the emperor writing
Virgil the most urgent letters begging the poet to send
him, then in Spain, some portion of the projected <i>Æneid</i>.
It was, however, considerably later when Virgil read to
Augustus the second, fourth, and sixth books, for the
young Marcellus, the emperor’s nephew, died in 23 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span>,
and we are told that Octavia, his mother, fainted on hearing
the poet read the immortal lines about her son in the
sixth book:—</p>

<p>“Child of a nation’s sorrow! Were there hope of thy
breaking the tyranny of fate, thou shalt be Marcellus.
Bring me handfuls of lilies, that I may strew the grave
with their dazzling hues, and crown, if only with these
gifts, my young descendant’s shade, and perform the vain
service of sorrow.”</p>

<p class="noindent">had already spent some ten years on the <i>Æneid</i>, when in
19 <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> he decided to devote three years to its revision

<p class="noindent">Augustus, however, met him at Athens and persuaded

It grew worse on the homeward trip; and he died, a few
days after landing, in Brundisium, having reached the
age of fifty-one. His tomb looks down upon the bay of

<h3 id="INFLUENCE_OF_THE_AENEID"><span class="smcap">Influence of the Æneid</span></h3>

<p>As to the success of the <i>Æneid</i>, it was immediate with
poets and people. Two years after Virgil’s death Horace
writes in his <i>Secular Hymn</i>:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<p class="noindent">Some of the scholars, indeed, criticised it as having an
undue simplicity, as coining new words and using old
words, with new meanings, as borrowing too freely from
Homer, as not written in chronological order, as containing
anachronisms, etc. But within ten years it was as
familiarly quoted by writers as we quote Shakespeare.
It became the chief text-book in the Roman schools of
grammar and rhetoric. The great writers of later days,
like Pliny and Tacitus, show the profound influence of his
style, which would seem to have gripped them as Goethe
tells us Luther’s translation of the Scriptures affected his
style, and as the King James version has left its indelible
traces on English literature.</p>

<p>When the race-mind tired of problems of government
and law, and turned strongly to the problems of religion,—degenerating
easily, to be sure, to superstition,—it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
was evidence of Virgil’s grip on humanity that the poet
of poets became the wizard of wizards. Even under the
Antonines, the <i>Sors Vergiliana</i> (Virgilian prophecy) was
practised. The <i>Æneid</i> was opened at random, and the
first verse that struck the eye was considered a prophecy
of good or bad portent. “The mediæval world looked
upon him as a poet of prophetic insight who contained
within himself all the potentialities of wisdom. He was
called the Poet, as if no other existed; the <i>Roman</i>, as if the
ideal of the commonwealth were embodied in him; the
<i>perfect in style</i>, with whom no other writer could be compared;
the <i>Philosopher</i>, who grasped the ideas of all
things; the <i>Wise One</i>, whose comprehension seemed to
other mortals unlimited. His writings became the Bible
of a race. The mysteries of Roman priestcraft, the processes
of divination, the science of the stars, were all
found in his works.”</p>

<p>True indeed are the words of Professor MacMechan:
“Beginning the <i>Æneid</i> is like setting out upon a broad and
beaten highway along which countless feet have passed
in the course of nineteen centuries. It is a spiritual highway,
winding through every age and every clime;” and
these of Professor Woodberry: “The <i>Æneid</i> shows that
characteristic of greatness in literature which lies in its
being a watershed of time; it looks back to antiquity in
all that clothes it with the past of imagination, character
and event, and forward to Christian times in all that
clothes it with emotion, sentiment, and finality to the
heart.”</p>

<p>As we approach modern literature, the great Italian
Dante consciously takes Virgil as his “master and author.”
“O glory and light of other poets! May the long zeal
avail me, and the great love, that made me search thy
volume. Thou art my master and my author.” On
English literature the influence of the <i>Æneid</i> has been so
potent that our space will hardly suffice to convey the
barest hint of its direct and indirect lines. Celtic story
developed from it a voyage of Brutus who founds a new<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
Troy, or London. Geoffrey of Monmouth in the twelfth
century sets forth this tale in his history. It was believed
down to the seventeenth century and is reported by Milton.
Elizabethan literature has frequent references to it.
Chaucer in his <i>House of Fame</i> outlines the <i>Æneid</i>, emphasizing
the Dido episode, which interested also Nash,
Marlowe, and Shakespeare. Spenser teems with allusions
and indeed translations, so—</p>

<p class="noindent">Bacon calls Virgil “the chastest poet and royalest that
to the memory of man is known.” “Milton,” writes
Dryden, “has acknowledged to me that Spenser was his
original.” But beside this indirect influence, and that
through the Italian school, Virgil’s direct influence on
Milton is attested by many an allusion. Dryden, Cowper,
with his “sweet Maro’s matchless strain,” Wordsworth,
Matthew Arnold, with his “sweet, tender Virgil,” freely
acknowledge the debt they owe our poet. Dryden and
Morris translated the <i>Æneid</i> into verse.</p>

the following tribute, written at the request of the Mantuans
for the nineteenth centenary of Virgil’s death:—</p>

<p>It is a lover of Horace (and who is not a lover of
Horace?), the brilliant Andrew Lang, who points out (in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
his <i>Letters to Dead Authors</i>) a vital difference that has
made Virgil’s the higher influence: “Virgil might wander
forth bearing the golden branch ‘the Sibyl doth to singing
man allow,’ and might visit, as one not wholly without
hope, the dim dwellings of the dead and the unborn. To
him was it permitted to see and sing ‘mothers and men,
and the bodies outworn of mighty heroes, boys and unwedded
maids, and young men borne to the funeral fire
before their parents’ eyes.’ The endless caravan swept
past him—‘many as fluttering leaves that drop and fall
in autumn woods when the first frost begins; many as
birds that flock landward from the great sea when now
the chill year drives them o’er the deep and leads them to
sunnier lands.’ Such things was it given to the sacred poet
to behold, and the happy seats and sweet pleasances of
fortunate souls, where the larger light clothes all the plains
and dips them in a rosier gleam, plains with their own new
sun and stars before unknown. Ah, not <i>frustra pius</i> was
Virgil, as you say, Horace, in your melancholy song. In
him, we fancy, there was a happier mood than your melancholy
patience.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_EPIC_ITSELF"><span class="smcap">The Epic Itself</span></h3>

<p>The purpose of the epic is to indicate the divinely
ordained origin and history of Rome as a conquering,
civilizing, and organizing government, destined to replace
both anarchy and tyrannical despotism by liberty under
law. As the real world-historic reason for Rome’s existence
is so commonly overlooked, let us recall Mommsen’s
words in the introduction to his <i>Provinces of the Roman
Empire</i>: “It fostered the peace and prosperity of the
many nations united under its sway longer and more
completely than any other leading power has ever succeeded
in doing.... If an angel of the Lord were to
strike the balance whether the domain ruled by Severus
Antoninus was governed with the greater intelligence
and the greater humanity at that time or in the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
day, whether civilization and national prosperity generally
have since that time advanced or retrograded, it is
very doubtful whether the decision would prove in favor
of the present.” Virgil states the function of Rome
clearly in the famous passage of the sixth book wherein
Greek and Roman are compared:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Forget not, O Roman, thy fate—to rule in thy might o’er the nations:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is to be thine art—peace to the world to give.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So the hero Æneas, himself of divine birth, is preserved
by divine intervention when Troy falls, and mid dire perils
for seven years’ voyagings, and all the bitter warring in
Italy, “to bring the gods unto Latium,” “to found a city,”
to teach Italy religion and a virile civilization. “Whence
Rome mighty in her defences,” “a task of so great magnitude
it was to build the Roman nation.” Twice,—once
in fields Elysian from the lips of sainted Anchises, and
again, portrayed on the shield that Vulcan made for
Æneas, is rehearsed the long line of legendary and historical
Roman heroes down to Augustus himself. “On this side
is Augustus Cæsar, leading the Italians to conflict, with
the senate and the people, the home-gods and their mighty
brethren, standing aloft on the stern.” “But Cæsar
... was consecrating to the gods of Italy a votive tribute
to deathless gratitude, three hundred mighty fanes the
whole city through.” “Such sights Æneas scans with
wonder on Vulcan’s shield ... as he heaves on his
shoulder the fame and the fate of grandsons yet to be”
(end of eighth book). Incidentally ground is given, in
compensating fate, for Rome’s conquest of Greek lands—she
is but loyal to her Trojan ancestry!—and for the duel
to the death with Semitic Carthage—whose queen once
was the stately Dido, left by King Æneas at Jove’s command!
Incidentally, too, Virgil draws from Trojan
origins governmental forms, religious rites, yes, even
games.</p>

<p>While this great task of glorifying patriotism and harmonizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xix"></a>[xix]</span>
it with loyalty to Cæsar is ever present to Virgil,
he cannot lose two qualities that make him the most
modern of ancient poets—his love of nature and his
pathos. As examples—of the former, it suffices to cite
the charming harbor scene succeeding storm and wreck,
in the first book; and, of the latter, the death-scene of
the immortal twain, Nisus and Euryalus (in Book nine).</p>

<p>“Down falls Euryalus in death; over his beauteous limbs
gushes the blood, and his powerless neck sinks on his
shoulders; as when a purple flower, severed by the plough,
pines in death, or poppies with faint necks droop the head,
when rain has chanced to weigh them down. But Nisus
rushes full on the foe ... and dying robs his foe of life.
Then he flung himself on his breathless friend, pierced
through and through, and there at length slept away in
peaceful death.</p>

<p>“Happy pair! if this my song has ought of potency, no
lapse of days shall efface your names from the memory
of time, so long as the house of Æneas shall dwell on the
Capitol’s moveless rock, and a Roman father shall be the
world’s lord.”</p>

<h3 id="THE_STORY"><span class="smcap">The Story</span></h3>

<p>The story on which Virgil builds is, briefly, the fall of
Troy, the voyaging of Trojan refugees under Æneas, and
the successful wars of Æneas with Italian barbarians.</p>

<p>According to the ancient legend the Greeks had warred
ten years under Troy’s walls, because the Trojan prince,
Paris, having awarded the prize of beauty to Venus as
against Juno and Minerva, and, having been promised
as reward by Venus Helen the beautiful wife of the Greek
Menelaus, had eloped with that fatal beauty to Troy, and
his father King Priam had refused to make restitution.</p>

<p>The story then, as related by Æneas to Queen Dido in her
palace at Carthage, takes up (in the second book of the
Æneid) the downfall and destruction of Troy, with the
escape of Æneas, his father and son, together with a band<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xx"></a>[xx]</span>
of Trojans. Then (in the third book) are depicted their
voyagings, unsuccessful attempts to found cities, and
arrival in Sicily. Here father Anchises dies. From
Sicily they sail in the endeavor to reach Latium in Italy.</p>

<p>It is at this point that the epic begins. So after his
invocation and introduction (in Book one), Virgil makes
unrelenting Juno, through the storm-king Æolus, let
loose upon the Trojan fleet a fierce tempest, which drives
the remnant of the fleet far away to the Carthaginian
coast. Æneas, directed by his disguised mother Venus,
comes to the court of Dido by whom he is kindly received,
banqueted; and at her request narrates (in Books two
and three) his harsh experiences.</p>

<p>Book four continues the Dido episode. The queen
madly loves Æneas—this through the influence of Venus,
who else had feared Carthaginian hostility to her dear
Trojans. Juno thinks to thwart the fates and Jove’s will
that Æneas should create the Roman race; and she plans
to hold Æneas as spouse of the Carthaginian queen. Jove
intervenes, sending Mercury with explicit commands to
Æneas to seek Italy. He sails, and Dido slays herself.</p>

<p>In Book five they reach Sicily again, and it being the
anniversary of Anchises’ death, Æneas celebrates it with
athletic contests. During these Juno again attempts to
thwart the fates, sending a messenger to incite the Trojan
women to set the fleet on fire. But this attempt is only
successful in so far as it leads Æneas to leave the weaklings
under the kindly sway of their kinsman, the Sicilian chief,
Acestes. The rest sail for Italy, losing the faithful pilot,
Palinurus.</p>

<p>Book six details the visit Æneas, under the guidance
of the Sibyl, to the abode of the dead. There he meets
again his father Anchises, who passes in review, as souls
about to be reborn into the upper world, their heroic
descendants.</p>

<p>So far, with the exception of Book two, which recorded
the fall and sack of Troy, a theme omitted by Homer,
Virgil has recorded the Odyssey or wanderings of his hero<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxi"></a>[xxi]</span>
Æneas. Now in the succeeding six books is given the
Iliad or wars of Æneas in Italy. As he lands, King
Latinus is divinely led to promise Æneas his daughter
Lavinia. But she has been betrothed to Turnus. Under
Juno’s prompting then begins this tremendous duel between
Æneas and Turnus. And here we note a curious
likeness between Milton and Virgil. As our sympathies
are aroused in the <i>Paradise Lost</i> for Lucifer, so Turnus,
“the reckless one,” looms up a figure of heroic size, doomed
by the fates to die that Rome may live.</p>

<h3 id="SOURCES"><span class="smcap">Sources</span></h3>

<p>As Virgil’s sources for his story and indeed for no small
portion of his language may be mentioned preeminently:—
Homer’s <i>Odyssey</i> and <i>Iliad</i>; Euripides,
“with his droppings of warm tears”; the Greek epic
poets, called the cyclic poets, as dealing with the cycle
of story revolving around Troy; the Greek freedman and
teacher, Livius Andronicus, who translated roughly the
<i>Odyssey</i>; Nævius, who wrote on the First Punic War,
tracing Carthaginian hostility back to the Æneas visit;
and especially Ennius, “father of Latin literature,” who
in a great epic traced the history of Rome from Æneas
down. Of Virgil’s borrowings it were enough perhaps to
say that, like our Shakespeare, he ennobled what he borrowed,
wove it into the texture of his song—stamped it
Virgilian.</p>

<h3 id="THE_TRANSLATION"><span class="smcap">The Translation</span></h3>

<p>Concerning the translation itself, we should perhaps set
over against Emerson’s famous saying, “I should as
soon think of swimming across Charles River when I wish
to go to Boston, as of reading all my books in originals,
when I have them rendered for me in my mother tongue,”
that other remark of a great scholar, that “the thing
for the student of language to learn is that <i>translation is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxii"></a>[xxii]</span>
impossible</i>.” Exquisitely done as is this version by Professor
Conington, noble student of Virgil as he was, some
faint notion of what is lost in the process might be gained
by comparing a prose version of, say, Longfellow’s “Evangeline”
with his hexameters themselves:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the very least, “the noblest measure ever moulded by
the lips of man,” Virgil’s “ocean-roll of rhythm,” is lost.
That indeed is not revived for us in Conington’s own
poetical version, not in Dryden’s, nor in Morris’s. Of
Virgil also that is true which T. B. Aldrich, charming poet
that he was, wrote me anent his own early translations,
“But who could hope to decant the wine of Horace?”</p>

<p>Yet it may be not without interest to compare some
verse renderings of the initial lines:—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">of Thrace, tires steed after steed, and heads the swift</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as she sees them, “Ho!<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> youths,” cries she, “if you</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thus Venus spoke, and Venus’ son replied:—“No sight</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Do this, and many a victim shall fall to thee at the altar</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Venus:—“Nay, I can lay claim to no such honours. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrian maidens, like me, are wont to carry the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quiver, and tie the purple buskin high up the calf. This</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that you now see is the Punic realm, the nation Tyrian</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the town Agenor’s<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>; but on the frontiers are the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Libyans, a race ill to handle in war. The queen is Dido,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who left her home in Tyre to escape from her brother.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lengthy is her tale of wrong, lengthy the windings of its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course; but I will pass rapidly from point to point. Her <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">husband was Sychæus, wealthiest of Phœnician landowners,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and loved by his poor wife with fervid passion;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on him her father had bestowed her in her maiden bloom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">linking them together by the omens of a first bridal. But</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the crown of Tyre was on the head of her brother, Pygmalion, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in crime monstrous beyond the rest of men.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They were two, and fury came between them. Impious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that he was, at the very altar of the palace, the love of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold blinding his eyes, he surprises Sychæus with his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stealthy steel, and lays him low, without a thought for <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his sister’s passion; he kept the deed long concealed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and with many a base coinage sustained the mockery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of false hope<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in her pining love-lorn heart. But lo! in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her sleep there came to her no less than the semblance of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her unburied spouse, lifting up a face of strange unearthly <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pallor; the ruthless altar and his breast gored with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steel, he laid bare the one and the other, and unveiled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from first to last the dark domestic crime. Then he urges</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her to speed her flight, and quit her home for ever, and in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aid of her journey unseals a hoard of treasure long hid in <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the earth, a mass of silver and gold which none else knew.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dido’s soul was stirred; she began to make ready her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flight, and friends to share it. There they meet, all whose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hate of the tyrant was fell or whose fear was bitter; ships,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that chanced to lie ready in the harbour, they seize, and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">freight with gold. Away it floats over the deep, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">greedy Pygmalion’s wealth; and who heads the enterprise?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a woman<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>! So they came to the spot where you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now see yonder those lofty walls, and the rising citadel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Carthage the new; there they bought ground, which <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">got from the transaction the name of Byrsa,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> as much as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they could compass round with a bull’s hide. But who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are you after all? What coast are you come from, or</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">whither are you holding on your journey?” That question</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he answers thus, with a heavy sigh, and a voice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fetched from the bottom of his heart:—</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fair goddess! should I begin from the first and proceed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in order, and hadst thou leisure to listen to the chronicle <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of our sufferings, eve would first close the Olympian gates</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and lay the day to sleep. For us, bound from ancient</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy, if the name of Troy has ever chanced to pass through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a Tyrian ear, wanderers over divers seas already, we have</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">coasts. I am Æneas, styled the good, who am bearing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with me in my fleet the gods of Troy rescued from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foe; a name blazed by rumour above the stars. I am in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quest of Italy, looking there for an ancestral home, and a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pedigree drawn from high Jove himself. With twice ten <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ships I climbed the Phrygian main, with a goddess mother</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">guiding me on my way, and a chart of oracles to follow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce seven remain to me now, shattered by wind and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wave. Here am I, a stranger, nay, a beggar, wandering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over your Libyan deserts, driven from Europe and Asia <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alike.” Venus could bear the complaint no longer, so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she thus struck into the middle of his sorrows:—</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whoever you are, it is not, I trow, under the frown of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">your way straight hence to the queen’s palace. For I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give you news that your comrades are returned and your</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">unless my learning of augury was vain, and the parents</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">in confusion over the wide unsheltered sky; see now how</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their line stretches, some alighting on the ground, others</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">just looking down on those alighted. As they, thus rallied, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ply their whirring wings<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> in sport, spreading their train</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">your vessels and your gallant crews are either safe in the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">port, or entering the haven with sails full spread. Only</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">go on, and where the way leads you direct your steps.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">She said, and as she turned away, flashed on their sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her neck’s roseate hue; her ambrosial locks breathed from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her head a heavenly fragrance; her robe streamed down <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to her very feet; and in her walk<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> was revealed the true</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goddess. Soon as he knew his mother, he pursued her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flying steps with words like these:—“Why wilt thou be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cruel like the rest, mocking thy son these many times</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with feigned semblances? Why is it not mine to grasp <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy hand in my hand, and hear and return the true language</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the heart?” Such are his upbraidings, while he</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">round with a dim cloud as they moved, and wrapped them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as a goddess only can in a spreading mantle of mist, that <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">none might be able to see them, none to touch them, or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">put hindrances in their path, or ask the reason of their coming.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She takes her way aloft to Paphos,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> glad to revisit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the abode she loves, where she has a temple and a hundred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">altars, smoking with Sabæan<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> incense, and fragrant with <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">garlands ever new.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They, meanwhile, have pushed on their way, where the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">which hangs heavily over the city, and looks from above</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the towers that rise to meet it. Æneas marvels at the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mass of building, once a mere village of huts; marvels at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the gates, and the civic din, and the paved ways. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrians are alive and on fire—intent, some on carrying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the walls aloft and upheaving the citadel, and rolling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stones from underneath by force of hand; some on making <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">choice of a site for a dwelling, and enclosing it with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trench. They are ordaining the law and its guardians, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the senate’s sacred majesty. Here are some digging out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">havens; there are others laying deep the foundation of a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">theatre, and hewing from the rocks enormous columns, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the lofty ornaments of a stage that is to be. Such are the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">toils that keep the commonwealth of bees<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> at work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the sun among the flowery meads when summer is</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">new, what time they lead out the nation’s hope, the young</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">a troop and expel from their stalls the drones, that lazy, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thriftless herd. The work is all afire, and a scent of thyme</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breathes from the fragrant honey. “O happy they, whose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city is rising already!” cries Æneas, as he looks upward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to roof and dome. In he goes, close fenced by his cloud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">miraculous to tell, threads his way through the midst, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and mingles with the citizens, unperceived of all.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A grove there was in the heart of the city, most plenteous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of shade—the spot where first, fresh from the buffeting of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wave and wind, the Punic race dug up the token which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queenly Juno had bidden them expect, the head of a fiery <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steed—for even thus, said she, the nation should be renowned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in war and rich in sustenance for a life of centuries.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here Dido, Sidon’s<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> daughter, was building a vast temple</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Juno, rich in offerings and in the goddess’s especial</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presence; of brass was the threshold with its rising steps, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clamped with brass the door-posts, the hinge creaked on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a door of brass. In this grove it was that first a new object</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">appeared, as before, to soothe away fear: here it was that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas first dared to hope that all was safe, and to place a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">better trust in his shattered fortunes. For while his eye <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranges over each part under the temple’s massy roof, as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he waits there for the queen—while he is marvelling at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the city’s prosperous star, the various artist-hands vying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with each other, their tasks and the toil they cost, he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beholds, scene after scene, the battles of Ilion, and the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war that Fame had already blazed the whole world over—Atreus’<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sons, and Priam, and the enemy of both,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Achilles. He stopped short, and breaking into tears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“What place is there left?” he cries, “Achates, what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clime on earth that is not full of our sad story? See there <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Priam. Here, too, worth finds its due reward; here, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there are tears<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> for human fortune, and hearts that are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">touched by mortality. Be free from fear: this renown</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ours will bring you some measure of safety.” So speaking,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he feeds his soul on the empty portraiture, with many</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a sigh, and lets copious rivers run down his cheeks. For</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he still saw how, as they battled round Pergamus,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Greeks were flying, the Trojan youth in hot pursuit; <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here the Phrygians, at their heels in his car Achilles, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that dreadful crest. Not far from this he recognizes with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tears the snowy canvas of Rhesus’ tent, which, all surprised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in its first sleep, Tydeus’ son was devastating with wide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage, himself bathed in blood—see! he drives off <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fiery steeds to his own camp, ere they have had time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to taste the pastures of Troy or drink of Xanthus.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> There</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in another part is Troilus<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> in flight, his arms fallen from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him—unhappy boy, confronted with Achilles in unequal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">combat—hurried away by his horses, and hanging half <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">out of the empty car, with his head thrown back, but the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reins still in his hand; his neck and his hair are being</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trailed along the ground, and his inverted spear is drawing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lines in the dust. Meanwhile to the temple of Pallas,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not their friend, were moving the Trojan dames with locks <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dishevelled, carrying the sacred robe, in suppliant guise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of mourning, their breasts bruised with their hands—the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goddess was keeping her eyes riveted on the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with her face turned away. Thrice had Achilles dragged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hector round the walls of Ilion, and was now selling for <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold his body, thus robbed of breath. Then, indeed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavy was the groan that he gave from the bottom of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his heart, when he saw the spoils, the car, the very body</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of his friend, and Priam, stretching out those helpless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hands. Himself, too, he recognizes in the forefront of <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Achæan ranks, and the squadrons of the East, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms of the swarthy Memnon.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> There, leading the columns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of her Amazons, with their moony shields, is Penthesilea<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in her martial frenzy, blazing out, the centre of thousands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as she loops up her protruded breast with a girdle of gold, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the warrior queen, and nerves herself to the shock of combat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a maiden against men.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While these things are meeting the wondering eyes of</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas the Dardan—while he is standing bewildered,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and continues riveted in one set gaze—the queen has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moved towards the temple, Dido, of loveliest presence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a vast train of youths thronging round her. Like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as on Eurotas’ banks, or along the ridges of Cynthus, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diana<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> is footing the dance, while, attending her, a thousand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mountain nymphs are massing themselves on either</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side; she, her quiver on her shoulder, as she steps, towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the whole goddess sisterhood, while Latona’s<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> bosom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrills silently with delight; such was Dido—such she <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bore herself triumphant through the midst, to speed the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">work which had empire for its prospect. Then, at the doors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the goddess, under the midmost vaulting of the temple,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a fence of arms round her, supported high on a throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she took her seat. There she was giving laws and judgments <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to her citizens, and equalizing the burden of their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tasks by fair partition, or draughting it by lot, when suddenly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas sees coming among the great crowd Antheus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Sergestus, and brave Cloanthus, and other of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teucrians, whom the black storm had scattered over the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deep, and carried far away to other coasts. Astounded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was he, overwhelmed, too, was Achates, all for joy and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fear: eagerly were they burning to join hands with theirs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but the unexplained mystery confounds their minds.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They carry on the concealment, and look out from the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hollow cloud that wraps them, to learn what fortune their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mates have had, on what shore they are leaving their fleet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what is their errand here—for they were on their way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a deputation from all the crews, suing for grace, and were</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">After they had gained an entrance, and had obtained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leave to speak in the presence, Ilioneus, the eldest, thus</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gracious queen, to whom Jupiter has given to found a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">vouchsafe a nearer view to our affairs. We are not come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to carry the havoc of the sword into the homes of Libya—to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snatch booty and hurry it to the shore; such violence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is not in our nature; such insolence were not for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the vanquished. There is a place—the Greeks call it <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hesperia—a land old in story, strong in arms and in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fruitfulness of its soil; the Œnotrians were its settlers;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now report says that later generations have called the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nation Italian, from the name of their leader. Thither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were we voyaging, when, rising with a sudden swell, Orion,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lord of the storm, carried us into hidden shoals, and far</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">away by the stress of reckless gales over the water, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">surge mastering us, and over pathless rocks scattered us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here and there: a small remnant, we drifted hither on to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your shores. What race of men have we here? What <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">country is so barbarous as to sanction a native usage like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this? Even the hospitality of the sand is forbidden us—they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">draw the sword, and will not let us set foot on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">land’s edge. If you defy the race of men, and the weapons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that mortals wield, yet look to have to do with gods, who <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">watch over the right and the wrong. Æneas was our king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">than whom never man breathed more just, more eminent</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Excited by her words, brave Achates and father Æneas,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">of all:—“Here am I whom you are seeking, before</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">presence, then at his enormous sufferings, and she bespoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him thus:—“What chance is it, goddess-born, that is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hunting you through such a wilderness of perils? what <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">violence throws you on our savage coasts? Are you, indeed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the famed Æneas, whom to Anchises the Dardan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Venus, queen of light and love, bore by the stream of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Simois? Aye, I remember Teucer coming to Sidon, driven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the borders of his fatherland, hoping to gain a new <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kingdom by the aid of Belus. Belus, my sire, was then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">laying waste the rich fields of Cyprus, and ruling the isle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a conqueror’s sway. Ever since that time I knew</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fate of the Trojan city, and your name, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pelasgian princes. Foe as he was, he would always extol</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Teucrians with signal praise, and profess that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he himself came of the ancient Teucrian stock. Come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then, brave men, and make our dwellings your home. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I, too, have had a fortune like yours, which, after the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">buffeting of countless sufferings, has been pleased that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I should find rest in this land at last. Myself no stranger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to sorrow, I am learning<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> to succour the unhappy.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With these words, at the same moment she ushers <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas into her queenly palace, and orders a solemn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sacrifice at the temples of the gods. Meantime, as if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this were nought, she sends to his comrades at the shore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">twenty bulls, a hundred huge swine with backs all bristling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a hundred fat lambs with their mothers, and the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and of princely purple—on the tables is massy <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">silver, and chased on gold the gallant exploits of Tyrian</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas, for his fatherly love would not leave his heart at</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">all a fond parent’s anxieties are centred. Presents,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moreover, rescued from the ruins of Ilion, he bids him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bring—a pall stiff with figures of gold, and a veil with</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Leda’s marvellous gift; the sceptre, too, which Ilione</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had once borne, the eldest of Priam’s daughters, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">string of pearls for the neck, and the double coronal of <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">jewels and gold. With this to despatch, Achates was</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the lady of Cythera is casting new wiles, new devices</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>

    <div class="verse indent0">arrive in the room of the charmer Ascanius, and by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presents he brings influence the queen to madness, and turn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the very marrow of her bones to fire. She fears the two-faced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">generation, the double-tongued sons of Tyre; Juno’s <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hatred scorches her like a flame, and as night draws on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">care comes back to her. So then with these words she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">addresses her winged Love:—“My son, who art alone my</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">I fly for aid, and make suppliant prayer of thy majesty.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How thy brother Æneas is tossed on the ocean the whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">world over by Juno’s implacable rancour I need not tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thee—nay, thou hast often mingled thy grief with mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He is now the guest of Dido, the Phœnician woman, and <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the spell of a courteous tongue is laid on him, and I fear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what may be the end of taking shelter under Juno’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wing; she will never be idle at a time on which so much</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hangs. Thus then I am planning to be first in the field,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">surprising the queen by stratagem, and encompassing <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her with fire, that no power may be able to work a change</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in her, but that a mighty passion for Æneas may keep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her mine. For the way in which thou mayest bring this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">about, listen to what I have been thinking. The young</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">At once Love complies with his fond mother’s words,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">soft couch of amaracus enfolds him with its flowers, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fragrant breath of its sweet shade. Meanwhile Cupid</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">he finds the queen already settled on the gorgeous tapestry <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of a golden couch, and occupying the central place. Already</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father Æneas, already the chivalry of Troy are flocking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in, and stretching themselves here and there on coverlets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of purple. There are servants offering them water</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for their hands, and deftly producing the bread from the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">baskets, and presenting towels with shorn nap. Within</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are fifty maidens, whose charge is in course to pile up provisions</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in lasting store, and light up with fire the gods of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hearth. A hundred others there are, and male attendants</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of equal number and equal age, to load the table with <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dishes, and set on the cups. The Tyrians, too, have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">assembled in crowds through the festive hall, and scatter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">themselves as invited over the embroidered couches.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There is marvelling at Æneas’ presents, marvelling at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iulus, at those glowing features, where the god shines <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through, and those words which he feigns so well, and at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the robe and the veil with the yellow acanthus border.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chief of all, the unhappy victim of coming ruin cannot</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the Phœnician woman, charmed with the boy and the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presents alike. He, after he has hung long in Æneas’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms and round his neck, gratifying the intense fondness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the sire he feigned to be his, finds his way to the queen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She is riveted by him—riveted, eye and heart, and ever</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and anon fondles him in her lap<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>—poor Dido, unconscious <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">how great a god is sitting heavy on that wretched bosom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But he, with his mind still bent on his Acidalian mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is beginning to efface the name of Sychæus letter by letter,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and endeavouring to surprise by a living passion affections</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long torpid, and a heart long unused to love.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When the banquet’s first lull was come, and the board</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">removed, then they set up the huge bowls and wreathe the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wine. A din rings to the roof—the voice rolls through <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those spacious halls; lamps<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> hang from the gilded ceiling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">burning brightly, and flambeau-fires put out the night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then the queen called for a cup, heavy with jewels and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold, and filled it with unmixed wine; the same which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had been used by Belus, and every king from Belus downward. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then silence was commanded through the hall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Jupiter, for thou hast the name of lawgiver for guest and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">host, grant that this day may be auspicious alike for the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrians and the voyagers from Troy, and that its memory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may long live among our posterity. Be with us, Bacchus,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the giver of jollity, and Juno, the queen of our blessings;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and you, the lords of Tyre, may your goodwill grace this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">meeting.” She said, and poured on the table an offering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the wine, and, the libation made, touched the cup</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">first with her lips, then handed it to Bitias, rallying his <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slowness. Eagerly he quaffed the foaming goblet, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drenched himself deep with its brimming gold. Then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">came the other lords in order. Iopas, the long-haired</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bard, takes his gilded lyre, and fills the hall with music;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he, whose teacher was the mighty Atlas.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
    His song<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> is of <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the wanderings of the moon and the agonies of the sun,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whence sprung man’s race and the cattle, whence rain-water</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and fire; of Arcturus and the showery Hyades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the twin Bears; why the winter suns make such</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">haste to dip in ocean, or what is the retarding cause that <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bids the nights move slowly. Plaudits redouble from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Tyrians, and the Trojans follow the lead. With</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">varied talk, too, she kept lengthening out the night, unhappy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dido, drinking draughts of love long and deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as she asked much about Priam, about Hector much; <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now what were the arms in which Aurora’s son had come</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Every tongue was hushed, and every eye fixed intently,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Too cruel to be told, great queen, is the sorrow you</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">heartrending sights which my own eyes saw, and the scenes</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">now, too, night is rushing in dews down the steep of heaven, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Yes, here were the troops of the Dolopes; here</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">set that way. But Capys, and the men of saner judgment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bid us send this snare of the Danaans, this suspicious present,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">it; or, if not that, to pierce and probe that hollow womb</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">rush in, and slaughter those they meet, and the whole <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wide space is flooded with soldiers. With far less fury,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when the river, all foam, has broken the prison of its banks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and streamed with triumphant tide over the barriers set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to check it, down it comes tumbling along the corn-fields,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and along the whole country sweeps away herd and stall. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With my own eyes I saw Neoptolemus, mad with carnage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the two Atridæ on the palace-floor. I saw Hecuba<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and her hundred daughters-in-law, and Priam at the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">promise of children’s children, doors gorgeous with barbaric</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold and plundered treasure, all sank in dust. Where</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Perhaps, too, you may be curious to hear the fate of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Priam. When he saw his city fallen and captured, the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">doors of his palace burst open, the foe in the heart of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">home’s sanctuary, poor old man! helplessly and hopelessly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he puts about his shoulders, trembling with age,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his armour, long disused, and girds on his unavailing sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and is going to his doom among the thick of the foe. In <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the midst of the palace, under the naked height of the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stood a great altar, and by it a bay tree of age untold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaning over the altar and enfolding the household gods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in its shade. Here about the altar Hecuba and her</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">by a murky tempest, huddled together and clinging to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Priam—yes, Priam—wearing the arms of his youth—‘What</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">monstrous thought,’ cries she, ‘my most wretched</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">what are you hurrying? It is not help like this, not protections</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">not even if my lost Hector were now at our side. Come, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">join us here at last; this altar shall be a defence for us all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or we will die together.’ With these words she took him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to where she was, and lodged his aged frame in the hallowed</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But, see! here is Polites, one of Priam’s sons escaped <span class="linenum">10</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Just as at last he won his way into the view and presence of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Hector’s lifeless body he gave back to the tomb, and sent</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">which the ringing brass at once shook off, and left hanging</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Now, for the first time grim horror prisoned me round—I <span class="linenum">10</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">back, my shoulders shall support you, nor shall I feel the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">task a burden. Fall things as they may, we twain will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">share the peril, share the deliverance. Let my little Iulus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">walk by my side, while my wife follows our steps at a</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">distance. You, our servants, attend to what I now say.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As you leave the city there is a mound, where stands an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancient temple of Ceres all alone, and by it an old cypress,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">observed these many years by the reverence of our sires.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This shall be our point of meeting in one place from <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">many quarters. You, my father, take in your hand these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sacred things, our country’s household gods. For me, just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">emerged from this mighty war, with the stains of carnage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fresh upon me, it were sacrilege to touch them, till I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have cleansed me in the running stream.’ <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So saying, I spread out my shoulders, bow my neck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cover them with a robe, a lion’s tawny hide, and take up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the precious burden. My little Iulus has fastened his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand in mine, and is following his father with ill-matched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steps, my wife comes on behind. On we go, keeping in the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shade—and I, who erewhile quailed not for a moment at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the darts that rained upon me or at the masses of Greeks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that barred my path, now am scared by every breath of air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">startled by every sound, fluttered as I am, and fearing alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for him who holds my hand and him I carry. And now I <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was nearing the gates, and the whole journey seemed accomplished,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when suddenly the noise of thick trampling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">feet came to my ear, and my father looks onward through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the darkness. ‘Son, son,’ he cries, ‘fly: they are upon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">us. I distinguish the flashing of their shields and the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gleam of their steel.’ In this alarm some unfriendly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">power perplexed and took away my judgment. For,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while I was tracking places where no track was, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swerving from the wonted line of road, woe is me! destiny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tore from me my wife Creusa. Whether she stopped, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or strayed from the road, or sat down fatigued, I never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">knew—nor was she ever restored to my eyes in life.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, I did not look back to discover my loss, or turn my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thoughts that way till we had come to the mound and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temple of ancient Ceres; then at last, when all were <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mustered, she alone was missing, and failed those who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should have travelled with her, her son and husband both.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom of gods or men did my upbraiding voice spare?</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">what sight in all the ruin of the city made my heart bleed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more? Ascanius and Anchises my father and the Teucrian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">household gods I give to my comrades’ care, and lodge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them in the winding glade. I repair again to the city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and don my shining armour. My mind is set to try every <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hazard again, and retrace my path through the whole of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy, and expose my life to peril once more. First</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I repair again to the city walls, and the gate’s dark entry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by which I had passed out. I track and follow my footsteps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back through the night, and traverse the ground <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with my eye. Everywhere my sense is scared by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horror, scared by the very stillness. Next I betake me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">home, in the hope, the faint hope that she may have turned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her steps thither. The Danaans had broken in and were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lodged in every chamber. All is over—the greedy flame <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is wafted by the wind to the roof, the fire towers triumphant—the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glow streams madly heavenwards. I pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on, and look again at Priam’s palace and the citadel. There</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">already in the empty cloisters, yes, in Juno’s sanctuary,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chosen guards, Phœnix and Ulysses the terrible, were <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">watching the spoil. Here are gathered the treasures of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy torn from blazing shrines, tables of gods, bowls of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">solid gold, and captive vestments in one great heap. Boys</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and mothers stand trembling all about in long array.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nay, I was emboldened even to fling random cries <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the darkness. I filled the streets with shouts, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in my agony called again and again on my Creusa with unavailing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">iteration. As I was thus making my search and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">raving unceasingly the whole city through, the hapless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shade, the spectre of my own Creusa appeared in my <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presence—a likeness larger than the life. I was aghast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my hair stood erect, my tongue clove to my mouth, while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she began to address me thus, and relieve my trouble</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with words like these: ‘Whence this strange pleasure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in indulging frantic grief, my darling husband? It is <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not without Heaven’s will that these things are happening:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">of heaven above. You have long years of exile, a vast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">expanse of ocean to traverse—and then you will arrive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the land of Hesperia, where Tiber, Lydia’s river, rolls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his gentle volumes through rich and cultured plains.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There you have a smiling future, a kingdom and a royal <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bride waiting your coming. Dry your tears for Creusa,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your heart’s choice though she be. I am not to see the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">face of Myrmidons or Dolopes in their haughty homes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or to enter the service of some Grecian matron—I, a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">No, I am kept in this country by heaven’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty mother. And now farewell, and continue to love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your son and mine. Thus having spoken, spite of my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tears, spite of the thousand things I longed to say, she left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me and vanished into unsubstantial air. Thrice, as I <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stood, I essayed to fling my arms round her neck—thrice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the phantom escaped the hands that caught at it in vain—impalpable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the wind, fleeting as the wings of sleep.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“So passed my night, and such was my return to my</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">swelled by a vast multitude of new companions, matrons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and warriors both, an army mustered for exile, a crowd</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">after that Ilion fell headlong from its pride, and Troy,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">we are driven by auguries from heaven to look elsewhere <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the exile’s home in lands yet unpeopled. We build us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a fleet under the shadow of Antandros,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and the range of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our own Phrygian Ida, all uncertain whither fate may</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carry us, where it may be our lot to settle, and muster</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">men for sailing. Scarcely had summer set in, when my <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father, Anchises, was bidding us spread our sails to destiny.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then I give my last tearful look to my country’s shores</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and her harbours, and those plains where Troy once stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but stands no longer. A banished man, I am wafted into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the deep with my comrades and my son, my household <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gods and their mighty brethren.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In the distance lies the land of the war-god, inhabited,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in vast extent—the Thracians are its tillers—subject</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">erewhile to Lycurgus’<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> savage sway, bound by old hospitality</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Troy, their household gods friends of ours, while <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our star yet shone. Hither I am wafted, and on the</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I was sacrificing to my parent, Dione’s<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> daughter, and <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rest of the gods, that they might bless the work I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had begun, and was slaying to the heavenly monarch of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">powers above a bull of shining whiteness on the shore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It happened that there was a mound near, on whose top</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were plants of cornel, and a myrtle bristling thick with <span class="linenum">30</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent0">spearlike wands. I drew near, and essayed to pull up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the ground the green forest growth, that I might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have leafy boughs wherewith to shadow the altar, when I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see a portent dreadful and marvellous to tell. For the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">first tree that I pull up from the soil, severing its roots, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from that tree trickle drops of black blood, staining the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">earth with gore. For me, a freezing shudder palsies my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame, and my chilled blood curdles with affright. Again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I go on to pluck the reluctant fibres of a second tree, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus probe the hidden cause to the bottom; as surely <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the bark of that second tree the black blood follows.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Much musing in my mind, I began to call on the nymphs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the wood, and Gradivus,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> our father, patron of the land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Thrace, that they might duly turn the appearance to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">good, and make the heavy omen light. But when I come <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to tear up a third spear-shaft with a still greater effort,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">straining with my knees against the sand which pressed on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them—ought I to tell the tale or hold my peace?—a lamentable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groan is heard from the bottom of the mound, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the utterance of a human voice reaches my ear: ‘Why, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas, mangle a wretch like me? Spare me at length in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my grave—spare those pious hands the stain of guilt.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was not an alien to you that Troy bore in bearing me—it</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">fly from this land of cruelty, fly from this shore of greed, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for I am Polydorus. Here I lie, pierced and buried by a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">growing crop of spears that has shot into sharp javelins.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then, indeed, terror, blank and irresolute, came over</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me—I was aghast—my hair stood erect, my tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clove to my mouth. Yes, this Polydorus had long ago <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">been sent secretly by Priam, unhappy then as ever, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a vast weight of gold, to be brought up by the king of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrace, when he had already come to despair of the arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Dardania, and saw the siege folding closer round his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city. When the power of the Trojans had been broken, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and their star set, the Thracian followed Agamemnon’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fortunes, and joined the standard of the conqueror—every</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tie of duty is snapped—he murders Polydorus, and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">by violence possesses himself of the gold. Cursed lust of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold, to what dost thou not force the heart of man? After</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the cold shuddering had ceased to tingle in my marrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I lay this portent from heaven before the select senate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of our nation, and my father as their chief, and ask them <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what they think. All are of the same mind, to depart from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the land of crime, to leave the home of violated friendship,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and indulge our fleet with the gales that wooed it. So we</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give Polydorus a solemn funeral: earth is heaped high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">upon his mound; there stand the altars reared to his <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">manes,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> in all the woe of dark fillets and sad-coloured</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cypress: and round them are daughters of Ilion, their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hair unbound in mourner fashion: we offer bowls of new</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">milk warm and frothing, and dishes of consecrated blood:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so we lay the spirit to rest in its grave, and with a loud <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">voice give the farewell call.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then, when the deep first looks friendly, and the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">We fall low on earth, and a voice is wafted to our ears:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">with a ready will. She shall tell you of the nations of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italy, and the wars of the future, and the way to shun or</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">in harmony with the yoke; yes,’ cries he, ‘there is hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of peace, too.’ With that we make our prayers to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sacred majesty of Pallas, queen of clanging arms, the first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to welcome us in the hour of our joy; and, according to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Helenus’ order, that order which he gave so earnestly, we <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">duly solemnize to Juno of Argos the prescribed honours.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, without dallying, soon as our vows were paid in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course, we turn landward the horns of our covered sail-yards,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and leave the homes of the sons of Greece, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fields we could not trust. Next we sight the bay of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tarentum, the city, if legend say true, of Hercules; right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against us rises the goddess of Lacinium, and the towers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Caulon, and Scylaceum, wrecker of ships. Then, in <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the distance, from the surge is seen Trinacrian Ætna;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the heavy groaning of the sea and the beating of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rocks is heard from afar, and broken voices on the beach,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the depths leap up to sight, and the sands are in a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turmoil with the surge. Then, my father, Anchises: ‘No <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">doubt this is that Charybdis; these the cliffs, these the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frightful rocks of Helenus’ song. Snatch us from them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comrades; rise on your oars as one man.’ They do no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">less than bidden; first of all Palinurus turned the plashing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prow to the waters on the left; for the left makes the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whole fleet, oars, winds, and all. Up we go to heaven on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the arched back of the wave; down again, as the water</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gives way under us, we sink to the place of death below.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice the rocks shouted in our ears deep in their stony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hollows; twice we saw the foam dashed up, and the stars <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all dripping. Meanwhile, tired and spent, we lose wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sunlight at once, and, in our ignorance of the way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">float to the land of the Cyclops.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There is a haven, sheltered from the approach of the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">thundering with appalling crashes; at one time it hurls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the sky a black cloud, a smoky whirlwind of soot and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glowing ashes, and upheaves balls of fire, and licks the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stars; at another it raises rocks, torn from the mountain’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bowels, and whirls heaps of molten stones into the air <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a groan, and boils up from its very foundations.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The legend is, that the body of Enceladus,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> blasted by</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the visitation of monstrous portents, yet see not what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cause produces the sound. For there was no starlight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no sky, bright with a heaven of constellations, but the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">firmament was dim and murky, and dead night was keeping</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And now the next day was breaking in early dawn,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Aurora had drawn off the dewy shadow from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sky, when suddenly from the woods comes forth the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strange figure of a man unknown, in piteous trim—a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">picture completed by Famine’s master-stroke, and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stretches his hands in supplication to the shore. We</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">look back: there was filth to make us shudder, a length</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of beard, a covering fastened with thorns; yet the rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">betokened a Greek, who had once been sent to Troy in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the army of his nation. As for him, when he saw from <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">afar the dress of Dardan land and the arms of Troy, for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a moment he faltered, scared by the sight, and checked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his steps; soon he ran headlong to the shore, crying and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">praying: ‘By the stars I adjure you, by the powers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">above, by this blessed light of heaven we breathe, take <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me with you, Teucrians; carry me off to any land you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will; this will be enough. I know I am one of the Danaan</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">for which, if the guilt of my crime is so black, fling me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">piecemeal to the waves, drown me deep in the great sea. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If I am to die, there will be pleasure in dying by the hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of men.’ His speech was over, and he was clinging about</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">us, clasping our knees, and writhing round them. We</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">encourage him to tell us who he is, of what race sprung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to reveal what fortune has since made him its sport. My <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father, Anchises, after no long pause, himself gives his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand to the youth, and reassures him by the powerful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pledge. He at length lays aside his fear, and speaks as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">follows:—</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘I come from Ithaca, a comrade of the ill-starred <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ulysses, my name Achemenides. I went to Troy, leaving</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my father, Adamastus, who was poor. Would that his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lot had remained mine! Here, in their hurry to leave</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">the door of the slaughterhouse, my comrades forgot me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and so left me behind in the Cyclops’ enormous den. It</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is a house of gore and bloody feasting, deep, and dark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and huge; its master towers aloft, and strikes the stars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on high (ye gods, remove from the earth a plague like <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this!), whom no eye rests on with pleasure, no tongue dare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">accost. The flesh of wretched men and their black blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are the food he feeds on. These eyes saw, when two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bodies from our company, caught by his huge hand, as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he threw back his head in the midst of the den, were <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">being brained against the rock, and the floor was plashed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and swimming with blood—they saw, when he was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crunching their limbs, dripping with black gore, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warm joints were quivering under his teeth. He did it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but not unpunished. Ulysses was not the man to brook <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a deed like this; the brain of Ithaca was not wanting to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">itself when the need was so great. For soon as, gorged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his food and buried in wine, he bent and dropped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his neck, and lay all along the den in unmeasured length,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">belching out gore in his sleep, and gobbets mixed with <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bloody wine; then we, having made our prayer to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">great gods and drawn our places by lot, surround him on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all sides as one man, and with a sharp weapon bore out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his eye, that vast eye, which used to lie single and sunk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under his grim brow,<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> and thus at last take triumphant <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vengeance for our comrades’ shades. But fly, unhappy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">men, fly, and tear your cable from the shore. For hideous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and huge as is Polyphemus, folding in his den his woolly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flocks and pressing their udders, as hideous and huge are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a hundred others that dwell everywhere along this coast, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">monster Cyclops, and stalk over the tall mountains. It</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is now the third moon, whose horns are filling out with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">light, that I am dragging along my life in the woods;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among the lonely lairs where wild beasts dwell, and looking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forth on the huge Cyclops as they stalk from rock to <span class="linenum">35</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">is supplied by the boughs, and herbage uprooted yields</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me food. As I turned my eyes all about, this fleet of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yours at last I saw advancing to the shore; with this, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prove it what might, I cast in my lot; it is enough to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have escaped this race of monsters. Sooner do you destroy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this life by any death you please.’</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Scarce had he ended, when on the mountain-top we</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see the giant himself, moving along with his enormous <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bulk among his cattle, and making for the well-known</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shore—a monster dreadful, hideous, huge, with his eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">extinguished. A pine, lopped by his own hand, guides</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him and steadies his footsteps. His woolly sheep accompany</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him—there is his sole pleasure, the solace of his <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suffering. After he had touched the waves of the deep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and come to the sea, he washes with its water the gore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that trickles from his scooped-out eye, gnashing his teeth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a groan; and he steps through the sea, now at main</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">height, while the wave has not yet wetted his tall sides. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We, in alarm, hasten our flight from the place, taking on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">board the suppliant, who had thus made good his claim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and silently cut the cable; then throw ourselves forward,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and with emulous oars sweep along the sea. He perceived</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it, and turned his steps towards the noise he heard. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when he finds he has no means of grasping at us with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his hand, no power of keeping pace with the Ionian waves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in pursuit, he raises a gigantic roar, at which the sea and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all its waters trembled inwardly, and the land of Italy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shuddered to its core, and Ætna bellowed through her <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">winding caverns. But the tribe of the Cyclops, startled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from wood and lofty mountain, rush to the haven and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fill the shore. There we see them standing, each with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the empty menace of his grim eye, the brethren of Ætna,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lifting their tall heads to heaven, a dire assemblage—like <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as on some tall peak, skyey oaks or cone-bearing cypresses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stand together, a lofty forest of Jupiter, or a grove of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diana. Headlong our crews are driven by keen terror to</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">fling out the ropes anywhither, and stretch their sails to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the winds that would catch them. On the other hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Helenus’ warning bids them not to hold on their way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">between Scylla and Charybdis, a passage on either side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">removed but a hair’s breadth from death; so our purpose <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stands to spread our sails backward. When lo! the north</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wind is upon us, sped from Pelorus’ narrow strait. On I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fly past Pantagia’s mouth of living rock, and the bay of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Megara, and low-lying Thapsus. Such were the coasts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">named to us by Achemenides, as he retraced his former <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wanderings—Achemenides, comrade of the ill-starred</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">whose territories you are settled? On one side the cities <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the Gætulians, a race invincible in war, and the Numidians</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Heaven’s auspices, I deem, and by Juno’s blessing, that</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">With the arms of the Teucrians at its back, to what a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">full on the sea, and Orion, the star of rain, while his ships</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are still battered, and the rigour of the sky still unyielding.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By these words she added fresh fuel to the fire of</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">love, gave confidence to her wavering mind, and loosed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Dido herself, in all her beauty, takes a goblet in her</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">of gleaming white, or moves majestic in the presence of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the gods towards the richly-laden altars, and solemnizes <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the day with offerings, and gazing greedily on the victims’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">opened breasts, consults the entrails yet quivering with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">life. Alas! how blind are the eyes of seers! What can</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the while a flame is preying on the very marrow of her <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bones, and deep in her breast a wound keeps noiselessly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alive. She is on fire, the ill-fated Dido, and in her madness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranges the whole city through, like a doe from an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arrow-shot, whom, unguarded in the thick of the Cretan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">woods, a shepherd, chasing her with his darts, has pierced <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from a distance, and left the flying steel in the wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unknowing of his prize; she at full speed scours the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forests and lawns of Dicte; the deadly reed still sticks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in her side. Now she leads Æneas with her through the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heart of the town, and displays the wealth of Sidon, and <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the city built to dwell in. She begins to speak, and stops</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">midway in the utterance. Now, as the day fades, she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seeks again the banquet of yesterday, and once more in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frenzy asks to hear of the agonies of Troy, and hangs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once more on his lips as he tells the tale. Afterwards, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when the guests are gone, and the dim moon in turn is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hiding her light, and the setting stars invite to slumber,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">by his father’s image, to cheat, if she can, her ungovernable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">passion. The towers that were rising rise no</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">ready havens and bulwarks for safety in war; the works</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are broken and suspended, the giant frowning of the</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as Jove’s loved wife saw that she was so mastered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the plague, and that good name could not stand in <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the face of passion, she, the daughter of Saturn, bespeaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Venus thus:—“Brilliant truly is the praise, ample the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spoils you are carrying off, you and your boy—great and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">memorable the fame, if the plots of two gods have really</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conquered one woman. No; I am not so blind either <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to your fears of my city, to your suspicions of the open</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">doors of my stately Carthage. But when is this to end?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or what calls now for such terrible contention? Suppose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for a change we establish perpetual peace and a firm marriage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bond. You have gained what your whole heart <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">went to seek. Dido is ablaze with love, and the madness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is coursing through her frame. Jointly then let us rule</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this nation, each with full sovereignty; let her stoop to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be the slave of a Phrygian husband, and make over her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrians in place of dowry to your control.” <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To her—for she saw that she had spoken with a feigned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">intent, meaning to divert the Italian empire to the coast of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Libya—Venus thus replied:—“Who would be so mad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as to spurn offers like these, and prefer your enmity to your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">friendship, were it but certain that the issue you name <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">would bring good fortune in its train? But I am groping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blindly after destiny—whether it be Jupiter’s will that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Tyrians and the voyagers from Troy should have one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city—whether he would have the two nations blended</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a league made between them. You are his wife; it <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is your place to approach him by entreaty. Go on, I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will follow.” Imperial Juno rejoined thus:—“That task</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall rest with me. Now, in what way our present purpose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">can be contrived, lend me your attention, and I will explain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in brief. Æneas and Dido, poor sufferer! are <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">proposing to go hunting in the forest, when first to-morrow’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sun displays his rising, and with his beams uncurtains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the globe. On them I will pour from above a black</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">storm of mingled rain and hail, just when the horsemen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are all astir, and spreading their toils before the wood-walks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the whole heaven shall be convulsed with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thunder. The train shall fly here and there, and be lost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the thick darkness. Dido and the Trojan chief shall <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">find themselves in the same cave. I will be there, and,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">if I may count on your sanction, will unite her to him in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lasting wedlock, and consecrate her his for life. Thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall Hymen<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> give us his presence.” The Queen of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cythera makes no demur, but nods assent, smiling at the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trick she has found out.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile Aurora has risen, and left the ocean. Rising</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the day-star, the chivalry of Carthage streams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the gates, their woven toils, and nets, and hunting-spears</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tipped with broad iron, and Massylian horsemen <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hurry along, and a force of keen-scented hounds.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are the Punic princes, waiting for the queen, who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">still lingers in her chamber; there stands her palfrey,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conspicuous in purple and gold, fiercely champing the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foaming bit. At length she comes forth, with a mighty <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">train attending, a Tyrian scarf round her, itself surrounded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by an embroidered border; her quiver of gold, her hair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">knotted up with gold, her purple robe fastened with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">golden clasp. The Phrygian train, too, are in motion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Iulus, all exultation. Æneas himself, comely beyond <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all the rest, adds his presence to theirs, and joins the procession;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like Apollo, when he leaves his Lycian winter-seat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the stream of Xanthus, and visits Delos, his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mother’s isle, and renews the dance; while with mingled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">voices round the altar shout Cretans and Dryopians, and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tattooed Agathyrsians. The god in majesty walks on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the heights of Cynthus, training his luxuriant hair with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soft pressure of a wreath of leaves, and twining it with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold; his arrows rattle on his shoulders. Not with less</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ease than he moved Æneas; such the beauty that sparkles <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in that peerless countenance. When they reach the high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mountains and the pathless coverts, see! the wild goats,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dropping from the tops of the crags, have run down the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">slopes; in another quarter the deer are scouring the open</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plains, massing their herds as they fly in a whirlwind of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dust, and leaving the mountains. But young Ascanius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is in the heart of the glens, exulting in his fiery courser.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now he passes one, now another of his comrades at full <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">speed, and prays that in the midst of such spiritless game</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he may be blest with the sight of a foaming boar, or that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a tawny lion may come down the hill. Meantime the sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">begins to be convulsed with a mighty turmoil; a storm-cloud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">follows of mingled rain and hail. The Tyrian train, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all in confusion, and the chivalry of Troy, and the hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Dardania, Venus’ grandson, have sought shelter in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their terror up and down the country, some here, some</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there. The streams run in torrents down the hills. Dido</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Trojan chief find themselves in the same cave. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Earth, the mother of all, and Juno give the sign.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lightnings blaze, and heaven flashes in sympathy with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bridal; and from mountain-tops the nymphs give the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nuptial shout. That day was the birthday of death, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">birthday of woe. Henceforth she has no thought for the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">common eye or the common tongue; it is not a stolen passion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that Dido has now in her mind—no, she calls it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">marriage; that name is the screen of her sin.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Instantly Fame<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> takes her journey through Libya’s great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cities—Fame, a monster surpassed in speed by none; her <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nimbleness lends her life, and she gains strength as she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goes. At first fear keeps her low; soon she rears herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">skyward, and treads on the ground, while her head is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hidden among the clouds. Earth, her parent, provoked to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">anger against the gods, brought her forth, they say, the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">youngest of the family of Cœus<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> and Enceladus—swift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of foot and untiring of wing, a portent terrible and vast—who,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for every feather on her body has an ever-wakeful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eye beneath, marvellous to tell, for every eye a loud tongue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and mouth, and a pricked-up ear. At night she flies midway <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">between heaven and earth, hissing through the darkness,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor ever yields her eyes to the sweets of sleep. In</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the daylight she sits sentinel on a high house-top, or on a</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">lofty turret, and makes great cities afraid; as apt to cling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to falsehood and wrong as to proclaim the truth. So</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then she was filling the public ear with a thousand tales—things</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">done and things never done alike the burden of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her song—how that Æneas, a prince of Trojan blood, had <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arrived at Carthage, a hero whom lovely Dido deigned to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">make her husband, and now in luxurious ease they were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wearing away the length of winter together, forgetful of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the crowns they wore or hoped to wear, and enthralled by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unworthy passion. Such are the tales the fiendlike goddess <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spreads from tongue to tongue. Then, in due course, she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turns her steps to King Iarbas, and inflames him with her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rumours, and piles his indignation high. He, the son of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ammon, from the ravished embrace of a Garamantian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nymph, built within his broad realms a hundred temples <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Jove, and in each temple an altar; there he had consecrated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an ever-wakeful fire, the god’s unsleeping sentry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a floor thick with victims’ blood, and doors wreathed with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">particoloured garlands. And he, frenzied in soul, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stung by the bitter tidings, is said, as he stood before the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">altars, with the majesty of Heaven all around him, to have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prayed long and earnestly to Jove with upturned hands:—“Jove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Almighty, to whom in this my reign the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moorish race, feasting on embroidered couches, pour out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the offering of the vintage, seest thou this? or is our dread <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of thee, Father, when thou hurlest thy lightnings, an idle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">panic? are those aimless fires in the clouds that appal us?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have their confused rumblings no meaning? See here:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a woman, who, wandering in our territories, bought leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to build a petty town, to whom we made over a strip of <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">land for tillage, with its rights of lordship, she has rejected</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an alliance with us, and received Æneas into her kingdom,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to be its lord and hers. And now that second Paris, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his emasculate following, a Mæonian<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> cap supporting his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chin and his essenced hair, is enjoying his prize, while we, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forsooth, are making offerings to temples of thine, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keeping alive an idle rumour.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus as he prayed, his hands grasping the altar, the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">almighty one heard him, and turned his eyes to the queenly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city and the guilty pair, lost to their better fame. Then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus he bespeaks Mercury, and gives him a charge like this:—“Go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">haste, my son, summon the Zephyrs, and float on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy wings; address the Dardan chief, who is now dallying <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in Tyrian Carthage, and giving no thought to the city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which Destiny makes his own; carry him my commands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the flying air. It was not a man like that whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his beauteous mother promised us in him, and on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strength of her word twice rescued him from the sword of <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Greece. No, he was to be one who should govern Italy—Italy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with its brood of unborn empires, and the war-cry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bursting from its heart—who should carry down a line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sprung from the grand fountain-head of Teucer’s blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and should force the whole world to bow to the laws<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> he <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">makes. If he is fired by no spark of ambition for greatness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like this, and will not rear a toilsome fabric for his own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">praise, is it a father’s heart that grudges Ascanius the hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Rome? What is he building? What does he look to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in lingering on among a nation of enemies, with no thought <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the great Ausonian family, or for the fields of Lavinium?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Away with him to sea! This is our sentence;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus far be our messenger.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jove had spoken, and Mercury was preparing to execute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the great sire’s command: first he binds to his feet his <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sandals, all of gold, which carry him, uplifted by their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pinions, over sea no less than land, with the swiftness of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the wind that wafts him. Then he takes his rod—the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rod with which he is wont to call up pale spectres from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">place of death, to send others on their melancholy way to <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tartarus, to give sleep or take it away, and to open the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eyes when death is past. With this in hand, he drives the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">winds before him, and makes a path through the sea of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clouds. And now in his flight he espies the crest and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tall sides of Atlas the rugged, who with his top supports <span class="linenum">35</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Cyllene’s god poised himself on his wings and rested; then</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">he flying between earth and heaven, between Libya’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sandy coast and the winds that swept it, leaving his</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as his winged feet alit among the huts of Carthage,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">wandering eyes aloft in the sky, sought for the light and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaned when she found it.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Juno almighty, in compassion for her lengthened</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">agony and her trouble in dying, sent down Iris<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> from <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Olympus to part the struggling soul and its prison of flesh.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For, as she was dying, not in the course of fate, nor for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">any crime of hers, but in mere misery, before her time, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">victim of sudden frenzy, not yet had Proserpine<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> carried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">off a lock of her yellow hair, and thus doomed her head to <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Styx and the place of death. So then Iris glides down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sky with saffron wings dew-besprent, trailing a thousand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">various colours in the face of the sun, and alights</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">above her head. “This I am bidden to bear away as an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">offering to Pluto, and hereby set you free from the body.” <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So saying, she stretches her hand and cuts the lock: at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once all heat parts from the frame, and the life has passed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into air.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas, meantime, was well on his road, holding with set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">purpose on the watery way, and cutting through billows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gloomed by the North wind, with eyes ever and anon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turned back to the city, which poor Elissa’s funeral flame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now began to illumine. What cause has lit up a blaze so <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty they cannot tell; but as they think of the cruel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pangs which follow outrage done on great love, and remember</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what a frantic woman can do, the Teucrian hearts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are swept through a train of dismal presage.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as the ships gained the mid-ocean, and no land met <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the view any more—waters everywhere and everywhere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">skies—a dark rain-cloud arose and stood over the hero’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">head, charged with night and winter tempest, and darkness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ruffled the billow’s crest. Palinurus himself, the pilot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was heard from the lofty stern:—“Ah! why has such an <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">army of storms encompassed the heaven? What hast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thou for us now, old Father Neptune?” No sooner said</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">than he bids them gather up the tackle and ply the lusty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oar, and shifts the sheet to the wind, and speaks thus:—“Noble</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas, though Jove himself were to pledge me <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his faith, I could not hope to reach Italy with a sky like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this. The winds shift and storm crosswise, ever rising</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the blackening West, and the mist is being massed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into clouds. We cannot make head against them, or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">struggle as we should. Well, since Fortune exerts her <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tyranny, let us follow, and turn our faces as she pulls the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rein. I take it, too, we are not far from the friendly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brother-coast of your Eryx, and the havens of Sicania,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">if my memory serves me as I retrace the stars I watched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long ago.” To him good Æneas:—“I have seen myself <span class="linenum">30</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>
    <div class="verse indent0">this long time that such is the winds’ will, and all your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">counter-efforts vain. Turn sail and ship. Could any</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">land indeed be welcomer, any that I would sooner choose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to harbour my weary ships, than the land which keeps for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me above ground the Darden Acestes, and laps in its breast <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bones of my sire Anchises?” This said, they make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the haven; favouring zephyrs swell their sail, the fleet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rides swiftly over the flood, and at last they touch with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">joy the strand they know so well.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">From a hill’s tall top Acestes had marked with wonder <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">afar off the new arrival, and the friendly vessels; up he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">runs, all in the savage trim of hunting-spear and Libyan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bearskin—Acestes, son of a Trojan mother by the river</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Crimisus. The ancestral blood quickens in his veins as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he gives them joy of their safe arrival, welcomes them <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the plenty of rustic royalty, and soothes their weariness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with every kind appliance.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On the morrow, when the first dawn of the bright dayspring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had put the stars to flight, Æneas calls his comrades</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to a gathering from all the shore, and standing on a heaped <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mound bespeaks them thus:—“Mighty sons of Dardanus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">race of Heaven’s high parentage, the months are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all past and the year has fulfilled its cycle, since we gave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the earth the earthly relics, the ashes of my deified sire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and consecrated the altars of mourning. And now, if I <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">err not, the very day is here—that day which for me shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ever be a day of weeping, ever a day of honour, since you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ye gods, have willed it so. Though this day were to find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me among the Gætulian Syrtes a homeless wanderer—were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it to surprise me in the Argive main or in the streets <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Mycenæ—still would I pay my yearly vows and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pomp of solemn observance, and would pile the altars with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their proper gifts. And now, behold, by an unsought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chance we are standing—not in truth I deem without the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">providence, the beckoning hand of Heaven—at the very <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grave, the buried ashes of my sire, driven as we are into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this friendly haven. Come, then, solemnize we all the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glad celebration; pray we for winds, and may He be</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">pleased that I should offer these rites yearly in a city of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my own building, in a temple dedicated to himself. Two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heads of oxen Acestes, like a true son of Troy, gives you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for each ship; call to the feasts the gods of the hearth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">both those of our fathers and those worshipped by Acestes <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our host. Furthermore, if the ninth day hence the dawn-goddess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">restore to mortals the genial light, and make the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">world visible with sunshine, I will set up, first of all, for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all Teucrian comers, a match among our swift fleet; then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">let him that is light of foot, and him that, glorying in his <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strength, bears himself more proudly with the dart and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flying arrow, or has confidence to join battle in gauntlets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of raw hide, let one and all be here, and look for the prizes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that victory earns. Give me your auspicious voices, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bind your brows with green.” <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This spoken, he shrouds his own brows with his mother’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">myrtle. So does Helymus, so does veteran Acestes, so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">young Ascanius—so the whole multitude of warriors.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was already on his way from the council to the tomb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with many thousands round him, the centre of a great <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">company. Here in due libation he pours on the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">two bowls of the wine-god’s pure juice, two of new milk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">two of sacrificial blood; he flings bright flowers, and makes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this utterance:—“Hail to thee, blessed sire, once more!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hail to you, ashes of one rescued in vain, spirit and shade <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of my father! It was not in Fate that thou shouldst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">journey with me to the Italian frontier and the fields of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Destiny, or see the Ausonian Tiber, whatever that name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may import.” He had said this, when from the depth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the grave a smooth shining serpent trailed along seven <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spires, seven volumes of giant length, coiling peacefully</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round the tomb and gliding between the altars: dark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">green flecks were on its back; its scales were all ablaze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with spots of golden lustre, even as the bow in the clouds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">showers a thousand various colours in the face of the sun. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas stood wonder-struck: the creature, winding its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long column among the dishes and the polished goblets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tasted of the viands, and then, innocent of harm, reëntered</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">the tomb at its base, leaving the altars where its mouth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had been. Quickened by this, the hero resumes the work</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of homage to his sire, not knowing whether to think this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the genius of the spot or his father’s menial spirit: duly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he slays two young sheep, two swine, two black-skinned <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bullocks; again and again he pours goblets of wine, again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and again he calls on the soul of great Anchises and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shade loosed from Acheron’s<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> prison. His comrades, too,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each according to his means, give glad offerings—they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pile the altars, they slay the bullocks; others in their function <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set on the cauldrons, and, stretched along the grass,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hold the spits over the embers and roast the flesh.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now the expected day was come; the steeds of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phaethon<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> were ushering in the goddess of the ninth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dawn through a heaven of clear light; the rumoured spectacle <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the great name of Acestes had brought the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">neighbouring people from their homes; the holiday crowd</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was flooding the shore, to gaze on the family of Æneas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and some, too, ready to dispute the prizes. First, in sight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of all, the gifts are bestowed in the midst of the ring—hallowed <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tripods and verdant chaplets, and palms, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conquerors’ special guerdon—armour and raiment of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">purple dye—a talent’s<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> weight of silver and gold; and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from a mound in the centre the shrill trumpet proclaims</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sports begun. The first contest, waged with labouring <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oars, is entered by four ships, the flower of the entire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fleet. There is Mnestheus, with his fiery crew, speeding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">along the swift Shark—Mnestheus, hereafter a prince of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italy, who gives his name to the Memmian line; there is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gyas with his monster Chimæra, that monster mass<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which three tiers of stout Dardans are pulling on, the oars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rising in a triple bank; Sergestus, from whom the Sergian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">house gains the name it keeps, sails in the mighty Centaur;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and in the sea-green Scylla Cloanthus, your great forefather,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cluentius of Rome. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At a distance in the sea is a rock, over against the spray-washed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shore—sometimes covered by the swelling waves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that beat on it, when the wintry north winds hide the stars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from view—in a calm it rests in peace, and rises over the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unruffled waters, a broad table-land, a welcome basking-ground <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the sea-bird. Here Æneas set up a green stem</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of leafy oak with his own royal hand—a sign for the sailors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that they might know whence to begin their return, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where to double round their long voyage. Then they choose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their places by lot: there are the captains on the sterns, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a glorious sight, gleaming far with gold and purple; the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crews are crowned with thick poplar leaves, and their bare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shoulders shine with the oil that has rubbed them. They</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seat them on the benches, every arm is strained on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oar—straining they expect the signal, and their beating <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hearts are drained at each stroke by panting fear and high-strung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ambition. Then, when the shrill trumpet has uttered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its voice, all in a moment dart forward from their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bounds, the seaman’s shout pierces the sky; the upturned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seas foam as the arm is drawn back to the chest. With <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">measured strokes they plough their furrows; the water</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is one yawning chasm, rent asunder by the oar and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pointed beak. Not such the headlong speed when in two-horse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">race the chariots dash into the plain and pour along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from their floodgates, or when the drivers shake the streaming <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reins over their flying steeds, and hang floating over</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the lash. Then plaudits, and shouts of manly voices,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the clamorous fervour of the backers, make the whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">woodland ring; the pent-up shores keep the sound rolling;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hills send back the blows of the noise. See! flying <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ahead of the rest, gliding over the first water in the midst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of crowd and hubbub, is Gyas; next him comes Cloanthus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with better oars, but the slow pinewood’s weight keeps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him back. After them at equal distance the Shark and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Centaur strive to win precedence. And now the Shark <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has it. Now she is beaten and passed by the Centaur.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now the two ride abreast stem to stem, cutting with their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long keels the salt waves. And now they were nearing the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">rock, and the goal was just in their grasp, when Gyas, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leader, the victor of the halfway-passage, calls aloud to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ship’s pilot Menœtes:—“Whither away so far to my right?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steer us hither; hug the shore; let the oar-blade graze</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the cliffs on the left; leave the deep to others.” Thus he; <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but Menœtes, afraid of hidden rocks, keeps turning the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prow well towards the sea. “Whither away from the right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course? Make for the rocks, Menœtes!” shouted Gyas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">again; and see! looking back, he perceives Cloanthus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gaining on him close behind. Between Gyas’ ship and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sounding rocks he threads his way to the left, steering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">inward, and in an instant passes the winner, leaves the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goal behind, and gains the smooth open sea. Grief turned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the youth’s very marrow to flame, nor were his cheeks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">free from tears; he seizes the slow Menœtes, forgetting <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at once his own decency and his crew’s safety, and flings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him headlong from the lofty stern into the sea. Himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">becomes their guide at the helm, himself their pilot, cheering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the rowers, and turning the rudder to the shore.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Menœtes, when at last disgorged from the bottom of <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sea, heavy with age, and with his dripping clothes all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hanging about him, climbs the cliff-top, and seats himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on a dry rock. The Teucrians laughed as he was falling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">laughed as he was swimming, and now they laugh as he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">discharges from his chest the draught of brine. Then <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sprung up an ecstatic hope in the two last, Sergestus and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mnestheus, of passing the lagging Gyas. Sergestus gets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the choice of water and comes nearer the rock—not first,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">however, he by a whole vessel’s length—half his ship is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ahead, half is overlapped by the beak of his rival, the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shark. Mnestheus walks through the ship among the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crew and cheers them on. “Now, now, rise to your oars,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">old Hector’s men, whom I chose to follow me at Troy’s last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gasp; now put out the strength, the spirit I saw you exert</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the Gætulian Syrtes, the Ionian Sea, the entangling <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">waves of Malea. It is not the first place I look for. I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">am not the man; this is no struggle for victory—yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">might it be!—but conquest is for them, Neptune, to</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">whom thou givest it. Let our shame be to come in last;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be this your victory, friends, to keep off disgrace.” Straining</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">every nerve, they threw themselves forward; their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty strokes make the brazen keel quiver, the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flies from under them; thick panting shakes their limbs, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their parched throats; sweat flows down in streams.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A mere chance gave them the wished preëminence; for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while Sergestus, blind with passion, keeps driving his prow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">towards the rock nearer and nearer, and pressing through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the narrow passage, his ill star entangled him with a projecting <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crag. The cliffs were jarred, the oars cracked as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they met the sharp flint, and the prow hung where it had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lodged. Up spring the sailors with loud shout, while the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ship stands still. They bring out their iron-shod poles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and pointed boat-hooks, and pick up the broken oars in <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the water. But Mnestheus, rejoicing, and keener for success,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with quick plashing oars, and the winds at his call,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">makes for the seas that shelve to the coast and speeds along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the clear expanse. Like as a dove suddenly startled in a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cave, where in the hollow of the rock are her home and her <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loved nestlings, issues out to fly over the plain, clapping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loud her pinions in terror in the cell—then, gliding smooth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the tranquil air, she winnows her liquid way without</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a motion of her rapid wings—so with Mnestheus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so the Shark, flying of herself, cuts through the last water <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the course, so the mere impulse bears her speeding on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First he takes leave of Sergestus, struggling with the tall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rock and the shallow water, and in vain calling for help, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">learning to run along with broken oars. Then he comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up with Gyas and the great monster Chimæra itself; she <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yields, because deprived of her pilot. And now there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">remains Cloanthus alone, just at the very end of the race;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him he makes for, and presses on him with all the force of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">effort. Then, indeed, the shouting redoubles—all lend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their good-will to spur on the second man, and the sky <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">echoes with the din. These think it shame to lose the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glory that they have won, the prize that is already their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own, and would fain barter life for renown; these are feeding</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">on success, they feel strong because they feel that they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are thought<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> strong. And perhaps their beaks would have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">been even and the prize divided, had not Cloanthus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stretching out both hands over the deep, breathed a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prayer and called the gods to hear his vow:—“Powers <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whose is the rule of ocean, whose waters I ride, for you with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glad heart will I lead to your altars on this shore a snow-white</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bull, as a debtor should; I will throw the entrails</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">afar into the salt waves, and pour out a clear stream of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wine.” He said, and deep down among the billows there <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heard him all the Nereids and Phorcus’ train, and maiden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Panopea, and father Portunus<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> himself, with his own great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand, pushed the ship as she moved; fleeter than south-wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or winged arrow she flies to the land and is lodged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">already deep in the haven. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Anchises’ son, duly summoning the whole company,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">proclaims by a loud-voiced herald Cloanthus conqueror,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and drapes his brow with green bay; he gives each</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crew a gift at its choice, three bullocks, and wine, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">present of a great talent of silver. To the captains themselves <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he further gives especial honours, to the conqueror</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a gold-broidered scarf, round which runs a length of Melibœan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">purple with a double Mæander; enwoven therein is the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">royal boy<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> on leafy Ida, plying the swift stag with the javelin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the chase, keen of eye, his chest seeming to heave; <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then, swooping down from Ida, the bearer of Jove’s armour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has snatched him up aloft in his crooked talons, while his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aged guardians are stretching in vain their hands to heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the barking of the hounds streams furious to the sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But for him whose prowess gained him the second place <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there is a cuirass of linked chain mail, three-threaded with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold, which the hero himself had stripped with a conqueror’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand from Demoleos on swift Simois’ bank under</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the shadow of Troy; this he gives the warrior for his own, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a glory and a defence in the battle. Scarce could the two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">servants, Phegeus and Sagaris, support its many folds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pushing shoulder to shoulder; yet Demoleos, in his day,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with it on his breast, used to drive the Trojans in flight</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">before him. The third present he makes a pair of brazen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cauldrons, and two cups of wrought silver, rough with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fretwork.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now all had received their presents, and each, glorying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in his treasure, was walking along with purple festooning <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round his brows, when Sergestus, at last with great pain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dislodged from the cruel rock, his oars lost and one whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side crippled, was seen propelling among jeers his inglorious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vessel. Like as a serpent surprised on the highway,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whom a brazen wheel has driven across, or a traveller, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavy of hand, has left half dead and mangled by a stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">writhes its long body in ineffectual flight, its upper part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all fury, its eyes blazing, its hissing throat reared aloft, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lower part, disabled by the wound, clogs it as it wreathes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its spires and doubles upon its own joints. Such was the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oarage with which the ship pushed herself slowly along:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she makes sail, however, and enters the haven with canvas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flying. To Sergestus Æneas gives the present he had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">promised, delighted to see the ship rescued and the crew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brought back. His prize is a slave, not unversed in Pallas’ <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">labours, Pholoë, Cretan born, with twin sons at her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breast.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This match dismissed, good Æneas takes his way to a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grassy plain, surrounded on all sides with woods and sloping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hills: in the middle of the valley was a circle, as of a <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">theatre; thither it was that the hero repaired with many</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thousands, the centre of a vast assembly, and sat on a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">raised throne. Then he invites, with hope of reward, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bold spirits who may wish to contend in the swift foot-race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sets up the prizes. Candidates flock from all <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sides, Teucrian and Sicanian mixed. Nisus and Euryalus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the foremost. Euryalus conspicuous for beauty and blooming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">youth, Nisus for the pure love he bore the boy; following</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them came Diores, a royal scion of Priam’s illustrious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stock; then Salius and Patron together, one from <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Acarnania, the other from Tegea, an Arcadian by blood;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">next two Trinacrian youths, Helymus and Panopes, trained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foresters, comrades of their elder friend, Acestes, and many</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">others, whom dim tradition leaves in darkness. As they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crowd round him, Æneas bespeaks them thus:—“Hear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what I have to say, and give the heed of a glad heart. No</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one of this company shall go away unguerdoned by me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will give a pair of Gnossian darts, shining with polished <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steel, and an axe chased with silver for the hand to wield.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This honour all shall obtain alike. The three first shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">receive prizes, and shall wear also wreaths of yellow-green</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">olive. Let the first, as conqueror, have a horse, full</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">decorated with trappings; the second an Amazonian <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quiver, full of Thracian shafts, with a belt of broad gold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to encompass it, and a buckle of a polished jewel to fasten</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it; let the third go away content with this Argive helmet.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This said, they take their places, and suddenly, on hearing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the signal, dash into the course, and leave the barrier <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">behind, pouring on like a burst of rain, their eyes fixed on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the goal. First of all, away goes Nisus, his limbs flying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">far before all the rest, swifter than wind and winged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thunderbolt; next to him, but next at a long distance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">follows Salius; then, at a shorter space, Euryalus third. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">After Euryalus comes Helymus; close on him, see! flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diores, heel touching heel and shoulder shoulder: were the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course but longer, he would be shooting on and darting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beyond him, and turning a doubtful race to a victory.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now they were just at the end of the course, all panting <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as they reached the goal, when Nisus, the ill-starred, slides</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in a puddle of blood, which lay there just as it had been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spilt after a sacrifice of bullocks, soaking the ground and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the growing grass. Poor youth! just in the moment of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">triumph, he could not keep his sliddery footing on the soil <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he trod, but fell flat in the very middle of unclean ordure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sacrificial gore. But he forgot not Euryalus—forgot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not his love—no! he threw himself in Salius’ way, rising</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in that slippery place—and Salius lay there too, flung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the puddled floor. Forth darts Euryalus, and gains <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the first place, a winner, thanks to his friend, cheered in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his flight by plaudit and shouting. Next comes in Helymus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Diores, thus made the third prize. But now</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Salius is heard, deafening with his clamour the whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">company in the ring and the seniors in the first rank, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">insisting that the prize, which he had lost by a trick, be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">restored him. Euryalus is supported by the popular voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the tears he sheds so gracefully, and the greater loveliness <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of worth when seen in a beauteous form. Diores</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">backs his claim with loud appealing shouts; he had just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">won the prize, and his attainment of the third place was all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for nothing if the first reward were to be given to Salius.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom father Æneas:—“Your rewards, boys, remain <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fixed as they ever were; no one disturbs the palm once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arranged: suffer me to show pity to a friend’s undeserved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">misfortune.” So saying, he gives Salius the enormous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hide of a Gætulian lion, loaded with shaggy hair and talons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of gold. On which Nisus:—“If the vanquished are <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rewarded so largely—if you can feel for tumblers—what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prize will be great enough for Nisus’ claims? My</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prowess had earned me the first chaplet, had not unkind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune played me foul, as she played Salius;” and with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these words he displayed his features and his limbs, all <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dishonoured by slime and ordure. The gracious prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">smiled at him, and bade them bring out a shield of Didymaon’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">workmanship, once wrested by the Danaans from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neptune’s hallowed gate, and with this signal present he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">endows the illustrious youth. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Next, when the race was finished, and the prizes duly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">given:—“Now, whoever has courage, and a vigorous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">collected mind in his breast, let him come forward, bind on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the gloves, and lift his arms.” Thus speaks Æneas, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sets forth two prizes for the contest: for the conqueror, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a bullock with gilded horns and fillet festoons; a sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a splendid helmet, as a consolation to the vanquished.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a moment, with all the thews of a giant, rises Dares,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">uprearing himself amid a loud hum of applause—the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sole champion who used to enter the lists with Paris: <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once, at the tomb where mighty Hector lies buried, he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">encountered the great conqueror Butes, who carried his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enormous bulk to the field with all the pride of Amycus’<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bebrycian blood—struck him down, and stretched him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in death on the yellow sand. Such are Dares’ powers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he lifts high his crest for the battle, displays his broad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shoulders, throws out his arms alternately, and strikes the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">air with his blows. How to find his match is the cry; <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no one of all that company dares to confront such a champion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and draw on the gauntlets. So, with confident</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">action, thinking that all were retiring from the prize, he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stands before Æneas, and without further prelude grasps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his left hand the bull by the horn, and bespeaks him <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus:—“Goddess-born, if no one dares to take the risk</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the fight, how long are we to stand still? How long is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it seemly to keep me waiting? Give the word for me to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carry off the prize.” A simultaneous shout broke from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sons of Dardanus, all voting that their champion should <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have the promised gift made good.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">On this Acestes, with grave severity of speech, rebukes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Entellus, just as he chanced to be seated next him on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">verdant grassy couch. “Entellus, once known as the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bravest of heroes, and all for nought, will you brook so <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">calmly that a prize so great be carried off without a blow?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where are we now to look for that mighty deity your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">master, Eryx, vaunted so often and so idly? Where is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that glory which spread all Trinacria through, and those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spoils that hang from your roof?” He replied: “It is <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not the love of praise, not ambition, that has died out,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">extinguished by fear. No, indeed; but my blood is dulled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and chilled by the frost of age, and the strength in my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">limbs withered and ice-bound. Had I now what I once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had, what is now the glory and the boast of that loud braggart <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there; had I but the treasure of youth, I should not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have needed the reward and the goodly bullock to bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me into the field; nor are gifts what I care for.” So saying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he flung into the midst a pair of gauntlets of enormous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weight, with which the fiery Eryx<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> was wont to <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deal his blows in combat, stringing his arms with the tough</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hide. Every heart was amazed, so vast were the seven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">huge bull-hides, hardened with patches of lead and iron.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">More than all the rest Dares is astonished, and recoils</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">many paces; and the hero himself, Anchises’ son, stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turning in his hands the massive weight and the enormous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrappers of twisted thong. Then the old man fetched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from his heart words like these:—“What if any one here <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had seen those mightier weapons, Hercules’ own gauntlets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the fatal combat on this very strand? These are the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms that Eryx, your brother, once wielded; you see on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them still the stains of blood and sprinkled brains. With</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these he stood up against the great Alcides. These I <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was trained to use while fresher blood inspired me with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strength, and the snows of age, my jealous rival, were not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yet sprinkled on my brows. But if Dares the Trojan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">refuses our Sicilian weapons, and that is good Æneas’ fixed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wish, approved by Acestes, my backer in the fight, make <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">we the contest even. I spare you the bull-hides of Eryx—never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fear—and do you put off your Trojan gauntlets.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So saying, he flung off from his shoulders his double garment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and displays the giant joints of his limbs, the giant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bone-work of his arms, and stands, a mighty frame, in <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the midst of the sand.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Anchises’ son brought out with his royal hand two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pairs of equal gauntlets, and bound round the fists of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">twain weapons of even force. At once each rose on tiptoe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and raised his arms undaunted to the air of heaven. They <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">draw back their towering heads out of the reach of blows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and make their fists meet in the melée, and provoke the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle. The one is better in quick movement of the foot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and youth lends him confidence; the other’s strength is in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brawny limbs and giant bulk, but his knees are heavy and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unstable, and a troubled panting shakes that vast frame.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many the blows that the champions hail on each other in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vain; many are showered on the hollow side, and draw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loud echoes from the chest. The fist keeps playing round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ear and temple; the teeth chatter under the cruel blow. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Heavily stands Entellus, unmoved, in the same strained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">posture; his bending body and watchful eye alone withdraw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him from the volley. His rival, like a general who</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">throws up mounds round a high-walled town, or sits down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his army before a mountain fort, tries now this approach,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now that, reconnoitres the whole stronghold, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plies him with manifold assaults, baffled in each. Rising</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the stroke, Entellus put forth his right hand, and raised <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it aloft; the other’s quick eye foresaw the downcoming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blow, and his lithe frame darts beyond its range. Entellus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has flung his whole force on air; at once, untouched by his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foe, the heavy giant, with heavy giant weight, falls to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">earth, even as one day falls hollow-hearted with hollow <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crash on Erymanthus or lofty Ida, uptorn by the roots, a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty pine. Eagerly start up at once the Teucrian and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trinacrian chivalry; up soars a shout to heaven; and first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">runs up Acestes, and soothingly raises from the ground</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his friend, aged as he. But not slackened by his overthrow, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor daunted, the hero comes back fiercer to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">field, with anger goading force; that mass of strength is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enkindled at last by shame and conscious prowess. All on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fire, he drives Dares headlong over the whole plain, now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his right hand showering blows, now with his giant <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left. No stint, no stay; thick as the hail with which the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">storm-clouds rattle on the roof, so thick the blows with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which the hero, crowding on with both hands, is battering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and whirling Dares. Then father Æneas thought fit to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stem the tide of fury, nor suffered Entellus’ wounded spirit <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to glut its rage further, but put an end to the fray, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rescued the gasping Dares with soothing words, and bespeaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him thus:—“My poor friend! what monstrous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">madness has seized you? See you not that strength has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">passed over—that the gods have changed their sides? <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Give way to Heaven.” He said, and his word closed the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fight. But Dares is in the hands of his faithful comrades,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dragging after him his feeble knees, dropping his head on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this side and on that, discharging from his mouth clotted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gore, teeth and blood together. Thus they lead him to <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the ships; summoned, they receive for him the helmet and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sword; the palm and the bull they leave to Entellus.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hereon the conqueror, towering in pride of soul, and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">exulting in his prize, the bull: “Goddess-born,” cries he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“and you, Teucrians, take measure at once of the strength</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which dwelt in my frame, while that frame was young,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the death from whose door you have called back,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and are still keeping, your Dares.” So saying, he took his <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stand full before the face of the bullock, which was there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the prize of the fray, and with arm drawn back, swung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the iron gauntlet right between the horns, rising to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">full height, crashed it down on the bone, and shattered the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brain. Prostrated, breathless, and quivering, on earth lies <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bull. He from his bosom’s depth speaks thus over</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the dead:—“This life, Eryx, I render to thee—a better</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">substitute for Dares’ death; here, as a conqueror may,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I resign the gauntlets and the game.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Next Æneas invites those who may care to vie in shooting <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fleet arrow, and sets forth the prizes. With his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own giant hand he rears upright the mast from Serestus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ship, and from its lofty summit ties a fluttering dove with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a cord passed round the mast—a mark for aiming the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steel. The archers are met; the lot has been thrown <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and received by the brazen helmet. See! first, among the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shouts of his friends, comes out before all the place of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hyrtacus’ son, Hippocoon, who is followed by Mnestheus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">late conqueror in the ship-race—Mnestheus, crowned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the green olive-wreath. Third comes Eurytion, thy <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brother, thrice glorious Pandarus, who in elder days,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bidden to destroy the truce, wast the first to wing thy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapon into the Achæan ranks. Last is Acestes, sank at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bottom of the helm, the old man’s spirit nerving his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arm to essay the task of the young. And now, with stern <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strength, they bend and arch their bows, each hero his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own, and draw forth the shaft from the quiver. First</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through heaven from the twanging string the arrow of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hyrtacus’ youthful son pierces sharp and shrill the flying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">air: it hits—it is lodged full in the mast-tree. After <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him stood keen Mnestheus, his bowstring drawn to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breast, his bow pointing upwards, eye and shaft levelled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at once. But the bird itself, hapless man! his arrow had</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">not power to touch that: it cut the knot and the hempen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fastening by which she hung, tied by the foot, from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mast’s top. Away she flew, all among the south-winds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and their murky clouds. Then, quick as thought, his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bow long since ready, and his shaft poised on the string, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eurytion breathed a vow to his brother, fixing his eye on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her in the moment of her triumph high up in the open sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and as she claps her wings, pierces the dark cloudy covert,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and strikes the dove. Down she drops unnerved, leaving</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her life among the stars of ether, and as she tumbles to <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">earth, brings back the arrow in her breast. Acestes remained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alone, a champion with no prize to gain; yet he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shot his weapon into the air aloft, displaying at once his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">veteran skill and the force of his twanging bow. And now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their eyes are met by a sudden portent, drawing a mighty <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">augury in its train. In after days the vast issue told the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tale, and terror-striking seers shrieked their omens too late.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For as it flew in the clouds of heaven, the reed took fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and marked its way with a trail of flame, and wasted and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vanished wholly into unsubstantial air; even as stars unfastened <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the firmament oft sweep across and drag</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their blazing hair as they fly. Fixed aghast to the spot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in prayer to Heaven, hung the stout sons of Trinacria and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy; nor does Æneas’ sovran judgment reject the omen.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He clasps the glad Acestes to his heart, loads him with <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">costly gifts, and bespeaks him thus:—“Take them, my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father; for Olympus’ mighty monarch has said by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">voice of these omens that yours is to be a prize drawn without</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a lot. From Anchises the aged himself comes the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">present I now bestow—a bowl embossed with figures, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which in old days Cisseus<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> gave to my sire Anchises in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">royal bounty, a standing remembrance of himself and a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">testimony of his love.” So saying, he crowns his brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with verdant bays, and proclaims, first of all, the conquering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">name of Acestes. Nor did good Eurytion grudge the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">preëminence, though he and none but he brought down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bird from the sky. Next steps into the prize he who cut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the cord; last, he whose quivering arrow nailed the mast</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But father Æneas, ere the match was over, calls to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side the guardian and companion of Iulus’ tender years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Epytides, and thus speaks into his ear in secret:—“Go</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now and tell Ascanius, if his company of boys is ready,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the movements of his young cavalry duly marshalled, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to bring them into the field in his grandsire’s honour, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">show himself in arms.” He, by his own voice, bids the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whole surging crowd retire from the length of the circus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and leave the field clear. The boys come prancing in on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">well-reined steeds, in even lines of light brightening their <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">parents’ eyes; and as they pass, an admiring shout, breaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the gathered chivalry of Sicily and Troy. All alike</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have their flowing hair duly cinctured with stripped leaves;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each bears two cornel javelins tipped with steel; some have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">polished quivers at their backs; round the top of the chest <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goes a pliant chain of twisted gold circling the neck.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three are the companies of horse, three the leaders that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scour the plain; twelve boys follow each, a glittering show,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in equal divisions and commanded alike. The first of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">youthful bands is led as to victory by a young Priam, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who revives his grandsire’s name, thy princely offspring,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Polites, destined to people Italy; him a Thracian steed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carries, dappled with spots of white, with white on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">extremes of his prancing feet, and white on his towering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brow. Next is Atys, whence comes the house of Roman <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Atii—Atys the young, the boyish friend of the boy Iulus.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Last of all, and excelling all in beauty, Iulus rides in on a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sidonian steed, bestowed on him by Dido the fair, in remembrance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of herself, and in testimony of her love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The remaining youth are borne on Trinacrian horses from <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">old Acestes’ stalls. The Dardans welcome them with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reassuring plaudits, and gaze on them with rapture, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trace in their young faces the features of their old sires.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as the riders have made their joyous survey of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whole gazing crowd and of their friends’ loving eyes, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Epytides gives the expected signal with far-reaching shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and loud cracking whip. In regular order they gallop asunder,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the three companies breaking and parting right and left;</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and again, at the word of command, they wheel round, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">charge each other with levelled lances. Then they essay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">other advances and other retreats in quarters still opposite,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each entangling each in circles within circles, and in their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">real armour raise an image of battle. Now they expose <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their backs in flight, now they turn their spear-points in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">charge, now as in truce they ride along side by side. Even</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as men tell of that old labyrinth<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> in lofty Crete, its way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cunningly woven with blind high walls, and the ambiguous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mystery of its thousand paths, winding till the pursuer’s <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">every trace was baffled by a maze without solution and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">without return, not unlike are the courses in which these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sons of the Teucrians interlace their movements—a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gamesome tangle of flying and fighting, as it were dolphins</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that swimming the watery seas dart through the Carpathian <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Libyan, and sport along the billows. Such</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was the form of exercise, and such the game that Ascanius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when he built the cincturing walls of Alba the Long, was the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">first to revive, and taught the early Latians to celebrate it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he had done in his boyhood, he and the youth of Troy <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with him; the men of Alba taught their sons; from them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty Rome received the tradition and maintained the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">observance of her sires; and the boys still bear the name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Troy, and their band is styled the band of Troy. Thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">far went the solemn<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> games in honour of the deified sire. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now it was that Fortune exchanged her old faith for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">new. While they are rendering to the tomb the due solemnities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the varied games, Juno, Saturn’s daughter, has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sped down Iris from heaven to the feet of Ilion, with breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of winds to waft her on her way—Juno, deep-brooding <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over many thoughts, her ancient wrath yet unsated.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Speeding along her many-coloured bow, seen of none, runs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swiftly down the celestial maid. She beholds that mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">concourse; she looks round on the coast, and sees harbour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">abandoned and fleet forsaken. Far away, in the privacy <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of a solitary beach, the Trojan dames were weeping for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lost Anchises, and, as they wept, were gazing, one and all,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wistfully on the great deep. Alas, that wearied souls</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">should still have those many waters to pass, and that vast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breadth of sea! Such the one cry of every heart. Oh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for a city! the toils of the main are a weariness to bear!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, then, in the midst of them, she suddenly alights—no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">novice in the ways of doing hurt—and lays by her heavenly <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">form and heavenly raiment. She takes the shape of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beroe, the aged wife of Doryclus of Tinaros, a dame who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once had had race and name and children, and in this guise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stands in the midst of the Dardan matrons. “Wretched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">women,” cries she, “not to have been dragged to the death <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of battle by the force of Achaia under our country’s walls!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hapless nation! What worse than death has Fortune in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">store for you? Here is the seventh summer rolling on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">since Troy’s overthrow, and all the while we are being</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">driven, land and ocean over, among all the rocks of an <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unfriendly sea, under all the stars of heaven, as through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the great deep we follow after retreating Italy, and are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tossed from wave to wave. Here is the brother-land of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eryx; here is Acestes, our ancient friend. Who shall gainsay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">digging a foundation, and giving a people the city <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they crave? O my country! O gods of our homes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snatched in vain from the foe! Shall there never be walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">named with the name of Troy? Shall I never on earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see the streams that Hector loved—his Xanthus and his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Simois? Come, join me in burning up these accursed <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ships. For in my sleep methought the likeness of Cassandra</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the seer put blazing torches into my hands. ‘Here,’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she said, ‘and here only, look for Troy: here, and here</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">only, is your home.’ The hour for action is come. Heaven’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wonders brook not man’s delay. See here! four <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">altars to Neptune. The god himself gives us the fire and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the will.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So saying, she is the first to snatch the baleful brand—swinging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back her hand on high; with strong effort she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whirls and flings it. The dames of Ilion gaze with straining <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mind and wildered brain. Then one of the crowd, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eldest of all, Pyrgo, the royal nurse of Priam’s many sons:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“No Beroe have you here, matrons—this is not Doryclus’</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">wife, of Rhoeteum—mark those signs of heavenly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beauty, those glowing eyes—what a presence is there—what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">features—what a tone in her voice—what majesty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in her gait! Beroe I myself parted from but now, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left her sick and sullen to think that she alone should fail <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at this observance, nor pay Anchises the honour that is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his due.” Such were her words, while the matrons, doubtful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at first, were looking on the ships with evil eyes, distracted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">between their fatal yearning for a country now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">theirs, and the voice of destiny from realms beyond the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sea—when the goddess, spreading her two wings, soared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up into the sky and severed the clouds as she flew with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">giant span of her bow. Then indeed, maddened by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">portent, goaded by frenzy, they shriek one and all, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snatch fire from house and hearth—some strip the altars, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and fling on the vessels leaf and bough and brand. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fire-god revels in full career along bench and oar, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">painted pine-wood stern. The news of the fleet on fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is carried by Eumelus to Anchises’ tomb, and the seats in</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">sparks and smoke in a black flickering cloud. First of all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascanius, riding in triumph at the head of his cavalry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spurred his horse just as he was to the wildering camp,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while his breathless guardians strive in vain to stay him.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“What strange madness this? whither now, whither <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">would ye go,” cries he, “my poor countrywomen? It is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not the Argive foe and his hated camp—it is your own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hopes that you are burning. See, I am your own Ascanius”—at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his feet he flung his empty helmet which he was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wearing in sport as he helped to raise the image of war. <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quick follows Æneas, quick the Teucrian host at his heels.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the matrons are flying in panic along the coast, now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here, now there, stealing to the thickest woods and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deepest caves. They loathe the deed and the daylight.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sobered, they know their friends again, and Juno is exorcised <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from their souls. But not for all this will blaze and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">burning resign their unslaked powers: deep among the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moistened timber smoulders the quick tow, discharging</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">a slow lazy smoke: the crawling heat preys on the keels,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the plague sinks down into the vessel’s every limb,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and strength of giant warriors and streaming water-floods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are all of no avail. Then good Æneas began to tear his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">raiment from his back and call the gods for aid, and raise <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his hands in prayer: “Jove Almighty, if thy hate would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not yet sweep off the whole Trojan race to a man, if thy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancient goodness has yet any regard for human suffering,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grant the fleet to escape from flame now, Father, even now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and rescue from death the shattered commonweal of Troy. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or else do thou with thy wrathful bolt send down this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">poor remnant to the grave, if that is my fit reward, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here with thy own right hand overwhelm us all.” Scarce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had the words been breathed, when a black tempest is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set loose, raging with fierce bursts of rain: the thunderpeals <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrill through highland and lowland—down from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole sky pours a torrent of blinding water, thickened</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to blackness by the southern winds—the ships are filled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the smouldering timbers soaked—till every spark is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quenched at last, and all the vessels, with the loss of four, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rescued from the deadly plague.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But father Æneas, staggering under this cruel blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">began to shift from side to side a vast burden of care, as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he pondered whether to settle in the plains of Sicily, shutting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his ears to Fate’s voice, or still make for the shores of <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italy. Then Nautes the aged—whom Tritonian Pallas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">singled from his kind, to teach her lore and dower him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the fame of abundant wisdom—hers the oracular</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">utterances which told what Heaven’s awful wrath portended,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or what the stern sequence of destiny required—he <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it was that addressed Æneas thus in words of comfort:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Goddess-born, be it ours to follow as Fate pulls us to or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fro; come what may, there is no conquering fortune but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by endurance. Here you have Acestes, the blood of Dardanus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and of gods mingling in his veins—make him the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">partner of your thoughts, and invite the aid he will gladly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give. Consign to him the crews whom your missing ships</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and of following your fortunes—the old, old men,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the matrons, weary of ocean, and whatever you have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that is weak and timorsome—set these apart, and suffer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them to have in this land a city of rest. The town’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with leave given, they shall call Acesta.” <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The fire thus kindled by the words of his aged friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now indeed the thoughts of his mind distract him utterly.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now black Night, car-borne, was mounting the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when the semblance of his sire Anchises, gliding from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven, seemed to break on his musings in words like <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these: “My son, dearer to me of old than life, while life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was yet mine—my son, trained in the school of Troy’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">destiny, I come hither at the command of Jove—of him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who chased the fire from your ships, and looked down on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your need in pity from on high. Obey the counsel which <span class="linenum">15</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">your youth, the stoutest hearts you have, let these and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these only follow you to Italy—hard and of iron grain is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the race you have to war down in Latium. Still, ere you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">go there, come to the infernal halls of Dis,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and travel <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through Avernus’ deep shades till you meet your father.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No, my son, godless Tartarus<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and its spectres of sorrow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have no hold on me—the company of the good is my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loved resort and Elysium<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> my dwelling. The virgin Sibyl</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall point you the way, and the streaming blood of black <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cattle unlock the gate. There you shall hear of your whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">posterity, and the city that Fate has in store. And now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">farewell, dark Night has reached the midst of her swift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">career, and the relentless Daystar has touched me with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breath of his panting steeds.” He said, and vanished, like <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">smoke, into unsubstantial air. “Whither away now?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cries Æneas; “whither in such haste? from whom are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you flying? what power withholds you from my embrace?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With these words he wakes to life the embers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and their slumbering flame, and in suppliance worships the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">god of Pergamus and hoary Vesta’s shrine with duteous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">meal and a full-charged censer.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At once he calls his friends to his side, and Acestes, first</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>

    <div class="verse indent0">father’s precept, and what is now the settled judgment of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his mind. Brief is the parley, nor does Acestes gainsay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his bidding. They remove the matrons to the new city’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">roll, and disembark a willing crew of hearts that need not <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the stir of great renown. For themselves they repair the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the oars and fit the ropes, a little band, but a living wellspring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of martial worth. Æneas, meanwhile, is marking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">out the city with the plough, and assigning the dwellings <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by lot, creating an Ilium here, and there a Troy. Acestes,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now the whole nation had enjoyed a nine days’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">banquet, and the altars had received due observance; <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sleeping winds have lulled the waves, and the repeated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whispers of the south invite to the deep once more. Uprises</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">along the winding shore a mighty sound of weeping;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prolonged embraces make day and night move slow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even the matrons, even the weaklings, who so lately <span class="linenum">20</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">of kindness, and tearfully commends them to Acestes, his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kinsman and theirs. Then he bids slay three calves to <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eryx, and a ewe-lamb to the weather gods, and in due</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile Venus, harassed with care, bespeaks Neptune,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and utters from her heart plaints like these: “The</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">that her monstrous malice has torn the heart from the breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Phrygia,<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> and dragged a city through an infinity of vengeance—the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">all in a moment—all ocean she confounded with heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blindly relying on Æolus’ storms to convulse a realm where</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thou art master. See now—goading the matrons of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy to crime, she has basely burnt their ships, and driven <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them in the ruins of their fleet to leave their mates to a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">whole hecatombs to Death, till the choked rivers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaned again, and Xanthus could not thread his way, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or roll himself into the sea—in that day, as Æneas confronted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Peleus’ mighty son with weaker arm and weaker aid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from heaven, I snatched him away in a circling cloud even</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while my whole heart was bent on overthrowing from their</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Troy. As my mind was then, it abides now. Banish thy</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With these words, having soothed to joy the goddess’</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And now father Æneas feels a soft thrill of succeeding</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">every mast be reared, every sail stretched on its yard-arm.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">One and all strain the rope and loosen the sheet, now right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now left—one and all turn to and fro the sailyard’s lofty <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horns; the fleet is wafted by the gales it loves. First,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">before all, Palinurus led the crowding ranks; after him the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rest, as bidden, shaped their course. And now dewy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Night had well-nigh reached the cope of heaven’s arch—in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">calm repose the sailors were relaxing their limbs, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stretched each by his oar along the hard benches—when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sleep’s power, dropping lightly down from the stars of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven, parted the dusky air, and swam through the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in quest of you, poor Palinurus, with a fatal freight of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dreams for your guiltless head. The god has sat down <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">high on the stern, in the likeness of Phorbas, and these are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the words he utters: “Son of Iasus, Palinurus, the sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">itself is steering the fleet; the winds breathe evenly and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fully; it is slumber’s own hour; come, relax that strained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">head, and let those weary eyes play truant from their toil. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I myself will undertake your functions awhile in your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stead.” Hardly raising his eyes, Palinurus answered him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus:—“<i>I</i> blind myself to smiling seas and sleeping</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">waves: is that your will? <i>I</i> place my faith on this fickle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">monster? What? trust Æneas to lying gales and fair</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">skies, whose fraud I have rued so often?” So he said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and went on cleaving and clinging, never dropping his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand from the rudder, nor his eye from the stars. When <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lo! the god waves over his two temples a bough dripping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with Lethe’s<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> dews, and drugged by the charms of Styx,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and in his own despite closes his swimming eyes. Scarce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had sudden slumber begun to unstring his limbs, when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the power, leaning over him, hurled him headlong into the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">streaming waves, tearing away part of the vessel’s stern</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the rudder as he fell, with many a cry for help that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">never came, while Sleep himself soared high on his wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into the yielding air. Safely, nevertheless, rides the fleet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the water, travelling undaunted in the strength of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Neptune’s royal promise. And now it was nearing the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cliffs of the Sirens’<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> isle, cliffs unfriendly in days of old, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">white with many a seaman’s bones, and the rocks were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sounding hollow from afar with the untiring surge, when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the great Father perceived the unsteady reel of the masterless <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ship, and guided it himself through the night of waters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaning oft, and staggering under the loss of his friend:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Victim of faith in the calm of sky and sea, you will lie,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Palinurus, a naked<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> corpse on a strand unknown.”</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Dædalus, so runs the legend, flying from Minos’ sceptre,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dared to trust himself in air on swift wings of his own workmanship,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sailed to the cold north along an unwonted way,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and at last stood buoyant on the top of this Eubœan hill. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grateful to the land that first received him, he dedicated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to thee, Phœbus, his feathery oarage, and raised a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temple. On the doors was seen Androgeos’ death: there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">too were the sons of Cecrops,<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> constrained—O cruel woe!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to pay in penalty the yearly tale of seven of their sons’ <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lives: the urn is standing, and the lots drawn out. On the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">other side, breasting the wave, the Gnossian land frowns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">responsive. There is Pasiphaë’s tragic passion for the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bull, and the mingled birth, the Minotaur, half man, half</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brute, a monument of monstrous love. There is the edifice,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that marvel of toiling skill, and its inextricable maze—inextricable,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">had not Dædalus in pity for the enthralling</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the craft and mystery of those chambers, guiding the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lover’s dark steps with a clue of thread. You too, poor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Icarus,<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> had borne no mean part in that splendid portraiture, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">would grief have given art its way. Twice the artist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">essayed to represent the tragedy in gold: twice the father’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hands dropped down palsied. So they would have gone on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scanning all in succession, had not Achates returned from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his errand, and with him the priestess of Phœbus and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Diana, Deïphobe, Glaucus’ daughter, who thus bespeaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the king: “Not this the time for shows like these; your</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">yoke, seven sheep duly chosen.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This said to Æneas, whose followers swiftly perform the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prescribed rites, she summons the Teucrians into the lofty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temple, herself its priestess. One huge side of the Eubœan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cliff has been hollowed into a cave, approached by a hundred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broad avenues, a hundred mouths—from these a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hundred voices are poured, the responses of the Sibyl. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just as they were on the threshold, “It is the moment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to pray for the oracle,” cries the maiden; “the god, the god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is here.” Thus as she spoke at the gate, her visage, her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hue changed suddenly—her hair started from its braid—her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bosom heaves and pants, her wild soul swells with <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frenzy—she grows larger to the view, and her tones are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not of earth, as the breath of the divine presence comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on her nearer and nearer. “What! a laggard at vows and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prayers? Æneas of Troy a laggard? for that is the only</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spell to part asunder the great closed lips of the terror-smitten <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shrine.” She said, and was mute. A cold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shudder runs through the Teucrians’ iron frames, and their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king pours out his very soul in prayer: “Phœbus, ever</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy’s pitying friend in her cruel agonies—thou who</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nature out of view, and the quicksands that environ their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coasts—now at last our hands are on the flying skirts of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italy. Oh, let it suffice Troy’s fortune to have followed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">us thus far! Ye too may now justly spare our nation of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pergamus, gods and goddesses all, whose eyes were <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">affronted by Troy and the great glories of Dardan land.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thou, most holy prophetess, that canst read the future</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the present, grant me—I am asking for no crown that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fate does not owe me—grant a settlement in Latium to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teucrians and their wandering gods, even the travel-tost <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deities of Troy. Then to Phœbus and his Trivian sister</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will set up a temple of solid marble, and appoint feast-days</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in Phœbus’ name. For thee too an august shrine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is in store in that our future realm. For there I will lodge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy oracles and the secret words of destiny which thou <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shalt speak to my nation, and consecrate chosen men to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy gracious service. Only commit not thy strains to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaves, lest they float all confusedly the sport of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whirling winds. Utter them with thine own mouth, I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">implore thee.” So his prayer ended. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the prophetess, not yet Phœbus’ willing slave, is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">storming with giant frenzy in her cavern, as though she</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">safety, little as you dream it, shall dawn on you from a</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Such are the words with which Cumæ’s Sibyl from her</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Acheron’s overflow, grant me to pass to the sight, to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and a driving tempest of darts on these my shoulders and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rescued him from the midst of the foe: he was the companion</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nay more—that I would kneel to thee and approach thy</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Jove most high.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Such were his prayers, while his hands clasped the altar,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">when thus the prophetess began: “Heir of the blood of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Avernus—all night and all day the gate of gloomy</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">stream. And now, if your heart’s yearning is so great,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your passion so strong, twice to stem the Stygian pool,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">twice to gaze on the night of Tartarus—if it be your joy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to give scope to a madman’s striving—hear what must</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">of gold, foliage alike and limber twig, dedicated to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">service of the Juno of the shades; it is shrouded by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whole labyrinth of the forest, closed in by the boskage that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">darkens the glens. Yet none may pierce the subterranean</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mystery, till a man have gathered from the tree that leafy <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sprout of gold, for this it is that fair Proserpine has ordained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to be brought her as her own proper tribute. Pluck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">off one, another is there unfailingly, of gold as pure, a twig</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">burgeoning with as fine an ore. Let then your eye be</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">found, for it will follow the touch with willingness and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ease, if you have a call from Fate; if not, no strength of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But, besides this, you have the breathless corpse of a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">said, and closed her lips in silence.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas, with saddened face and steadfast eye, moves on,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaving the cave behind, and revolves in his mind the secrets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the future. Achates, ever faithful, walks at his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side, and plants his foot with no less consciousness of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">care. Many were the things exchanged in their ranging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">talk—who could be the dead comrade that the priestess <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spoke of, what the corpse that needed burial. And lo!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Misenus, soon as they came, there on the dry beach they</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">stir men’s hearts with his clarion, and kindle with music <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the war-god’s flame. Hector the great had been his chief:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in Hector’s service he performed a warrior’s part, famous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alike with the trumpet and the spear. But after the conquering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arm of Achilles robbed his master of life, valiant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hero, he made himself the comrade of the Dardan Æneas, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor found the standard he followed meaner than of old.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But in those days, as he was making his hollow shell ring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the waters, infatuate mortal, challenging the gods to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">compete, Triton, roused to jealousy, seized him, if the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">that laps among the rocks. So they all stood round, uttering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loud shrieks; louder than the rest Æneas the good.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And then without delay they set about the Sibyl’s bidding,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weeping sore, and in mournful rivalry heap up the funeral</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pyre with trees, and carry it into the sky. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Away they go to an ancient wood, the wild beast’s tall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">covert—down go the pitch-trees; the holm-oak rings with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the axe’s blows, and so do the ashen beams; the wedge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cleaves through the fissile<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> oak; they roll down from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heights huge mountain ashes. There is Æneas, in this, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as in other labours, the first to cheer on his comrades, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wielding a weapon like theirs; and thus he ponders in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sad silence of his own breast, looking at the immeasurable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wood, and thus gives utterance to his prayer: “Oh that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at this moment that golden branch on the tree would reveal <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">itself to our sight in all this depth of forest! for I see that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in all things the prophetess has told us of you, Misenus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alas! too truly!” Scarce had he spoken, when, as by</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">chance, a pair of doves come flying along the sky, under the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hero’s very eyes, and settle on the turf at his feet. At once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the mighty chief recognizes his mother’s birds, and gladly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breathes a second prayer: “Oh guide us on our way, wherever</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it be, and as ye fly direct our steps into the grove <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where the precious branch casts its shade on the rich</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ground! Thou too forsake not our perplexity, O goddess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mother!” Thus much he said, and checked his advancing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foot, watching to see what prognostics they bring, whither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they aim their onward course. They, as they graze, go <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ever forward on the wing, as far as the eyes of the travellers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">can keep them in view. Then when they come to Avernus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">noisome jaws, swiftly they soar aloft, and gliding through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the clear sky, settle twain on the same tree, their chosen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seat, whence there flashed through the branches the contrasted <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gleam of gold. Even as in the woods, in the cold of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">midwinter, the mistletoe is wont to put forth new leaves, a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vegetable growth, but of no parent tree, and with its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yellow produce to surround the tapering boles, so looked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the leafy gold among the holm-oak’s dark shade—so in the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">light breeze tinkled the foil. Æneas snatches it at once,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plucks it off with eagerness overpowering its delay, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carries it to the home of the prophetic Sibyl.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime, with not less zeal, the Teucrians on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shore were mourning for Misenus, and paying the last <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">honour to the thankless ashes. First they raised a pile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unctuous with pine-wood, and high-heaped with planks of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oak: they wreath its sides with gloomy foliage, and set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up before it funeral cypresses, and adorn it with a covering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of refulgent armour. Some make ready heated water and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cauldrons bubbling over the fire, and wash and anoint the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cold corpse. Loud rings the wail: then, the dirge over,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they place the limbs on the couch that claims them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and fling over them purple garments, the dead men’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">usual covering. Some put their shoulders to the heavy <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bier in melancholy service, and after ancestral fashion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with averted eyes, apply the torch from under. The rich</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heap is ablaze—offerings of incense, sacrificial viands, oil</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">streaming from the bowl. After that the ashes were fallen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in and the blaze was lulled, they drenched with wine the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">relics and the thirsty embers on the pyre, and Corynæus</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">He, too, carried round pure water, and sprinkled thrice <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the comrades of the dead, scattering the thin drops with</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and spoke the last solemn words. But good Æneas raises</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the dead a monument of massive size, setting up for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hero his own proper arms, the oar and the trumpet, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under a skyey mountain, which is now from him called</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">heavily along in his boat of iron-gray, himself already in</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and warriors, and bodies of mighty heroes discharged of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">life, boys and unwedded maidens, and youths laid on the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">now those, while others he drives away, and bars them <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the river’s brink. Æneas cries as a man perplexed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and startled by the tumult: “Tell me, dread maiden,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what means this concourse to the stream? Of what are</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Anchises’ son stood and paused, musing deeply, and pitying</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">wandering without death’s last tribute, Leucaspis and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orontes, the captain of Lycia’s fleet: both had sailed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with him from Troy over the stormy water, and the south</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wind whelmed them both, engulfing the vessel and its</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Lo! he sees his pilot, Palinurus, moving along—Palinurus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who but now, while voyaging from Libya, his eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bent on the stars, had fallen’ from the stern, flung out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into the wide waste of waters. So when he had at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">taken knowledge of his features, now saddened, in the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deep gloom, he thus accosts him first: “Who was it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Palinurus, of all the gods, that tore you from us, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whelmed you in the wide sea? Tell me who. Till now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I never found him false; but in this one response Apollo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has proved a cheat, foretelling that you would be unharmed <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the deep, and win your way to the Ausonian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frontier, and thus it is that he keeps his word!” “Nay,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">returned he, “my chief, Anchises’ son, Phœbus’ tripod has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">told you no lie, nor did any god whelm me in the sea.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No, I chanced to fall, tearing away by main force the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rudder, to which I was clinging like sentry to his post,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as I guided your course, and dragging it with me in my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">headlong whirl. Witness those cruel waters, I felt no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fear for my own life like that which seized me for your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ship, lest, disarmed and disabled, shaken loose from her <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ruler’s hand, she should give way under the great sea that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was rising then. Three long nights of storm the south</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wind swept me over the vast wilderness of convulsed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ocean. Hardly at last, at the fourth dawn, I looked out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aloft upon Italy from the crest of the wave. Stroke by <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stroke I was swimming to shore; and now I was just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">laying hold on safety, had not the savage natives come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on me, sword in hand, clogged as I was with my dripping</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">clothes, and clutching with talon fingers the steep mountain-top,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and deemed blindly they had found a prize.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now the wave is my home, and the winds keep tossing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me on the beach. Oh, by heaven’s pleasant sunshine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and bright sky; by your father, I adjure you; by the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">promise growing up with your Iulus, rescue me with that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unconquered arm from this cruel fate: be yourself, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">either spread earth upon me, for that you can surely do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and put back to Velia’s haven; or, if any way there be,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">any that your goddess mother can reveal—for well I <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ween it is not without Heaven’s leave that you purpose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to stem these fearful tides and the reluctant pool of Styx—stretch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your hand to your poor friend, and take me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with you over the water, that at least I may find in death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a place of rest and peace.” So had he spoken, when thus <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the priestess begins: “What demon, Palinurus, has set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on you so monstrous a desire? You, unburied, look on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Stygian water, and the dread river of the furies?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You set foot on the bank unbidden? Cease to dream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that Heaven’s destiny can be swayed by prayer. Yet <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hear and retain a word which may console your hard lot.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For know that the dwellers in that fatal border, goaded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">far and wide through their cities by prodigies from heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall propitiate your dust: they shall erect a tomb, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through that tomb send down your funeral dues, and the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spot shall bear forever the name of Palinurus.” These</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">words allayed his cares, and banished for a while grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from that sad bosom: his heart leaps to the land that is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">called by his name.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">They accordingly continue their journey, and approach <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the river. Soon as the boatman saw them, at the moment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the wave of Styx, moving through the stilly forest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and turning their steps to the bank, he first bespeaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them thus, and assails them unaccosted: “You, whoever</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">trim, speak your errand from the spot where you</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">may not be ferried in my Stygian barque. Nay, it was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not to my joy that I gave Alcides a passage over the lake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor Theseus and Pirithous, born of gods though they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were, and of strength unsubdued. The one laid a jailer’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand on the warder of Tartarus, even at the foot of the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king’s own throne, and dragged him trembling along:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the others essayed to carry off the queen from Pluto’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bridal chamber.” To which the Amphrysian priestess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">replied in brief: “Here there are no stratagems like those;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be not discomposed; these weapons are not borne for <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">violence; the monstrous guardian of your gate is free to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">once the angry swell subsides, and the breast is calm. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No further parley. Gazing in wonder at the sacred offering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the fated bough, last seen so long ago, he turns to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them the sea-green boat, and draws near the bank.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then he dislodges other ghostly passengers who were sitting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">along the benches, and clears the gangways, while <span class="linenum">25</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">has eaten to the heart, in the privacy of hidden walks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and an enshrouding myrtle wood: their tender sorrows <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quit them not even in death. In this region he sees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phædra and Procris, and sad Eriphyle, pointing to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wounds of her ruthless son, and Evadne, and Pasiphaë:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">along with them moves Laodamia, and Cæneus, once a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man, now a woman, brought back by the turn of fate to <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her former self. Among these was Phœnicia’s daughter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dido, fresh from her death-wound, wandering in that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty wood: soon as the Trojan hero stood at her side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and knew her, looming dimly through the dusk—as a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man sees or thinks he sees through the clouds, when the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">month is young, the rising moon—his tears broke forth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and he addressed her tenderly and lovingly. “Unhappy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dido! and was it then a true messenger that reached</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">me with the tale that you were dead: that the sword</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had done its worst? Was it, alas, to a grave that I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brought you? By the stars of heaven I swear, by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">powers above, by all that is most sacred here underground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against my will, fair queen, I quitted your coast. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No; it was the command of the gods; the same stern</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">force which compels me now to pass through this realm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of shade, this wilderness of squalor and abysmal night;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it was that which drove me by its uttered will: nor could</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have thought that my departure would bring on you <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">such violence of grief. Stay your step, and withdraw not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the look I bend on you. Whom would you shun?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the last word which fate suffers me to address you is this.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With words like these, Æneas kept soothing the soul that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blazed forth through those scowling eyes, and moving <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself to tears. She stood with averted head and eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the ground, her features as little moved by the speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he essayed as if she held the station of a stubborn flint,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or a crag of Marpessa.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> At length she flung herself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">away, and, unforgiving still, fled into the shadow of the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wood, where her former lord, Sychæus, answers her sorrows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his, and gives her full measure for her love.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, none the less, Æneas, thrilled through and through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by her cruel fate, follows far on her track with tears, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sends his pity along with her. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thence he turns, to encounter the appointed way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now they were already in the furthest region, the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Here there meets him Tydeus, here Parthenopæus, illustrious</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Thersilochus, the three sons of Antenor, and Polyphœtes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ceres’ priest, and Idæus, with his hand still on the car, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">still on the armour. They surround him, right and left,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">they saw the hero and his armour gleaming through the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">backs in flight, as erst they fled to the ships: others raise <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a feeble war-shout. The cry they essay mocks their</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Here it is that he sees Priam’s son, mangled all over,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">hands—his temples despoiled of his ears, and his nose <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lopped by unseemly carnage. Scarce, in truth, he recognized</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him, trembling as he was, and trying to hide the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">terrible vengeance wreaked on him: unaccosted, he addresses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him in the tones he knew of old: “Deiphobus,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">has had the ambition to avenge himself so cruelly? who</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">on that fatal night that you had sunk down, tired with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the work of slaughtering the Greeks, on a heap of undistinguished</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage. Then with my own hand, I set up <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an empty tomb on the Rhœtean shore, and thrice with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loud voice invoked your spirit. There are your name and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your arms to keep the spot in memory: your self, dear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">friend, I could not see, so as to give you repose in the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Dear friend, you have failed in nought: all that Deiphobus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">could claim has been paid by you to him and to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shade. No; it was my own destiny and the deadly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wickedness of the Spartan woman that plunged me thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deep in ill: these tokens are of her leaving. How we <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spent that fatal night in treacherous joyance you know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">well: too good cause is there to bear it in mind. When</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fateful horse at one bound surmounted the height of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pergamus, and brought a mailclad infantry in its laden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">womb, she feigned a solemn dance, and led round the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city Phrygian dames in Bacchic ecstasy; herself in their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">midst raising a mighty torch aloft, and calling to the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">with care and overborne with sleep, was in the hold of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our ill-starred bridal chamber, weighed down as I lay, by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slumber sweet and sound, the very image of the deep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">calm of death. Meantime, my peerless helpmate removes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the house arms of every sort: yes, my trusty sword <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she had withdrawn from my pillow, and now she calls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Menelaus to come in, and throws wide the door, hoping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I doubt not, that the greatness of the boon would soften</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her lover’s heart, and that the memory of her crime of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the story long? They burst into the chamber, along with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them that child of Æolus,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> then as ever the counsellor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of evil. Recompense, ye gods, the Greeks in kind, if</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But you; what chance has brought you here in your lifetime, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">let me ask in turn? Are you come under the spell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ocean-wandering, or by the command of heaven? or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what tyranny of fortune constrains you to visit these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sad, sunless dwellings, the abode of confusion?”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In this interchange of talk, the Dawn-goddess in her <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flushing car, careering through the sky, had well passed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the summit of the arch; and perchance they had spent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all their allotted time in converse like this, had not the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sibyl warned her companion with brief address: “Night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is hastening, Æneas; and we, as we weep, are making <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hours pass. This is the spot where the road parts in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">twain. The right, which goes under the palace-wall of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty Dis—there lies our way to Elysium; the left</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">puts in motion the tortures of the wicked, and sends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them to Tartarus, the home of crime.” Deiphobus replied: <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Frown not, dread priestess; I depart, to make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the ghostly number complete, and plunge again in darkness.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Go on your way, our nation’s glory, go: may your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">experience of fate be more blest.” He said, and, while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yet speaking, turned away. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Suddenly, Æneas looks back, and, under a rock on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left, sees a broad stronghold, girt by a triple wall; a fierce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stream surrounds it with surges of fire, Tartarean Phlegethon,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and tosses craggy fragments in thunder. Full in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">front is a vast gate, its pillars of solid adamant. No force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of man, not even the embattled powers of heaven, could</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">break it down. Rising in air is a turret of iron, and Tisiphone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a gory robe girt round her, sits at the vestibule <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with sleepless vigilance night and day. Hence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sounds of wailing meet the ear, and the crack of remorseless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whips; the clank of steel follows, and the trailing of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the chain. Æneas stood still, riveted by the terror of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the noise. “What shapes is guilt wearing now? tell me, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dread maiden. What are the torments that lie on it so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hard? what mean these loud upsoaring shrieks?” The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">priestess returned: “Noble leader of the Teucrians, no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">innocent foot may tread that guilty threshold; but the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">day when Hecate set me over the groves of Avernus, she <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">taught me from her own lips the punishments of Heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and led me through from end to end. Here rules Gnosian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rhadamanthus, a reign of iron—avenger, at once, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">judge of cowering guilt, he compels a confession of what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crimes soever men in upper air, blindly rejoicing in the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cheat, have kept secret till the hour of death, to be expiated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then. In a moment, Tisiphone the torturer, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">uplifted scourge, lashes from side to side the spurned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and guilty soul; and brandishing in her left hand knots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of serpents, summons her unpitying sisterhood. Then at <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">last, grating on their dread-sounding hinge, the awful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gates are opened. See you what manner of sentry is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seated at the entrance? what a presence is guarding the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">threshold? Know that a Hydra fiercer yet with fifty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">monstrous throats, each a yawning pit, holds her seat <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">within. Then there is the abyss of Tartarus in sheer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">descent, extending under the shades, twice as far as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man’s skyward gaze from earth to the heaven of Olympus.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here are earth’s ancient progeny, the Titan brood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hurled down by the thunderbolt to wallow in the depths <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the gulf. Here too saw I the twin sons of Aloeus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frames of giant bulk, who essayed by force of hand to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pluck down the mighty heavens, and dislodge Jove from</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">his realm in the sky. I saw too Salmoneus, smitten with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cruel vengeance, while mimicking the fires of Jove and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rumblings of Olympus. Borne in a four-horse car, a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flaring torch in hand, he was making his triumphal progress <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the tribes of Greece, and the midst of Elis’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city, and bidding men accord him a god’s homage. Madman!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to counterfeit the storm-cloud and the unrivalled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thunderbolt with the rattle of brass and the beat of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horses’ horny hoofs. But the almighty sire from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">depth of his cloudy dwelling hurled his weapon—no <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">futile firebrand his, no pinewood’s smoky glare—and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dashed him headlong down with that tremendous blast.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tityos, too, the foster-child of Earth’s common breast, it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was mine to see: his body lies extended over nine whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">acres, and there is a monstrous vulture with hooked beak <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shearing away his imperishable liver, and reaping a harvest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of suffering from his vitals, as it digs deep for its meal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and burrows in the cavern of his breast, nor gives the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">new-growing filaments rest or respite. What need to tell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the Lapithæ, of Ixion<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> and Pirithous—men who live <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under a black crag, ever falling, and just in act to drop?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The lofty couch is spread for the banquet, and the pillar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of gold gleams underneath: the feast is before them,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">couched at their side: she will not let them stretch a hand <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the board: she starts up with torch uplifted and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thunder in her tones. Here are they who lived in hatred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with their brethren while life yet was; who smote a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">parent or wove for a client the web of fraud; who gained</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a treasure and brooded over it alone, and never shared it <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with their kin—a mighty number these—adulterers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who were slain for their crime; citizens who followed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the standard of treason; slaves who shrunk not from</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">their doom. Ask not <i>what</i> doom is theirs, what <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">phase, what fate has whelmed them so deep. Others roll</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">unhappy Theseus: and Phlegyas, from the depth</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">voice of terror through the shades: ‘Learn hereby to be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">righteous, and not to scorn the gods.’ This sold his country</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for gold, and saddled her with a tyrant; for gain he <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">made and unmade laws: this assailed his daughter’s bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and essayed a forbidden union: all dared some monstrous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crime, and enjoyed their daring. No; had I even a hundred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tongues, and a hundred mouths, and lungs of iron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not then could I embrace all the types of crime, or rehearse <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole muster-roll of vengeance.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So spoke Apollo’s aged priestess; and then resuming:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“But come,” she cries, “speed on your way, and fulfil</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the walls which the Cyclopian forge raised in air, and the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arched gates confronting us, where sacred rule bids us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set down our offering.” As she spoke, they step side by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side through the dusky ways, despatch the interval of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">distance, and draw near the gate. Æneas masters the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">approach, sprinkles his body with pure spring water, and <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fixes the branch on the portal’s front.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now these things done at length, and the offering</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">an ampler plenitude and a dazzling lustre; and the eye</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">wooded banks. Here is a noble company who braved <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wounds in fight for fatherland; all the priests who kept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their purity while life was; all the poets whose hearts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were clean, and their songs worthy Phœbus’ ear; all who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by cunning inventions gave a grace to life, and whose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">worthy deeds made their fellows think of them with love: <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each has his brow cinctured with a snow-white fillet.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Looking on the multitude as it streamed around, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sibyl bespoke them thus—Musæus before all; for he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stands the centre of that vast crowd, which looks up to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell us, happy spirits, and you, best of bards, which is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anchises’ haunt? which his home? for it is to see him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that we have come hither, and won our way over the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">“Here there are no fixed abodes: our dwellings are in <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shadowy groves: our settlements on the velvet slope of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">come, if you will, climb this hill with me, and I will set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your feet at once on a road that will lead you.” So saying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he moves on before, and from the top of the ridge <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">points to broad fields of light, while they descend from</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But father Anchises, down in the depth of the green</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as he saw Æneas advancing through the grass to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">his lips: “And are you come at last? has love fulfilled</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">way? is it mine to look on your face, my son, and listen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and reply as we talked of old? Yes; I was even thinking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so in my own mind. I was reckoning that it would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be, counting over the days. Nor has my longing played</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me false. Oh, the lands and the mighty seas from which <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you have come to my presence! the dangers, my son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that have tossed and smitten you! Oh, how I have feared</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lest you should come to harm in that realm of Libya!”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The son replied: “Your shade it was, father, your melancholy</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">his face. Thrice, as he stood, he essayed to fling his <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms round that dear neck: thrice the phantom escaped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hands that caught at it in vain, impalpable as the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Lethe,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> which floats along by those abodes of peace.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the humming fills the plain. Startled at the sudden <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sight, Æneas wonderingly inquires what it means, what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are those waters in the distance, or who the men that are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thronging the banks in crowds so vast. To him his father</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">while time lasts shall the land of Romulus take such pride</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in any that she has reared. Woe for the piety, for the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancient faith, for the arm unconquered in battle! Never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">would foeman have met that armed presence unscathed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">marched he on foot into the field or tore with bloody spur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the flank of his foaming steed. Child of a nation’s sorrow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were there hope of thy breaking the tyranny of fate, thou <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shalt be Marcellus. Bring me handfuls of lilies, that I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may strew the grave with their dazzling hues, and crown,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">perform the vain service of sorrow.” Thus they wander</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here and there through the whole expanse in the broad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fields of shadow and take note of all. Soon as Anchises</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had taken his son from end to end, and fired his mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the prospect of that glorious history, he then tells <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the warrior of the battles that he must fight at once, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">informs him of the Laurentian<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> tribes and Latinus’ town,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and how to shun or stand the shock of every peril.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">There are two gates of Sleep: the one, as story tells,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of horn, supplying a ready exit for true spirits: the other <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gleaming with the polish of dazzling ivory, but through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it the powers below send false dreams to the world above.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thither Anchises, talking thus, conducts his son and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sibyl, and dismisses them by the gate of ivory.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">traces his way to the fleet and returns to his comrades; <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then sails along the shore for Caieta’s haven. The anchor</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And thou, too, in thy death, Caieta,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> nurse of Æneas, hast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left to our coast the heritage of an ever-living fame; still in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this later day thy glory hovers over thy resting-place, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a name on Hesperia’s mighty seaboard is thy monument,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">if that be renown. So when good Æneas had paid the last <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dues and raised a funeral mound, and had waited for the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">calming of the deep, he spreads sail and leaves the harbour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nightward the breezes blow, nor does the fair Moon scorn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to show the way: her rippling light makes the sea shine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">again. The next land they skirt is the coast of Circe’s <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">realm, where in queenly state the daughter of the Sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrills her forest fastness with never-ending song, and in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her haughty mansion burns fragrant cedar to give light by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">night, as she draws her shrill comb over the delicate warp.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From the shore they heard the growling noise of lions in <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrath, disdaining their bonds and roaring in midnight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hour, bristly boars and caged bears venting their rage, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shapes of huge wolves fiercely howling: things which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Circe, fell goddess, had transformed by her magic drugs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the mien of man to a beast’s visage and a beast’s hide. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So, lest the pious race of Troy should suffer such monstrous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">change, were they to seek harbour there or approach the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">perilous shore, Neptune filled their sails with favouring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breezes, sped their flight along, and wafted them past the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The sea was just reddening in the dawn, and Aurora was</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">car, when all at once the winds were laid, and every breath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sank in sudden sleep, and the oars pull slowly against the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">smooth unmoving wave. In the same moment Æneas, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">flying among the woods. He bids his comrades turn aside <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and set their prows landward, and enters with joy the</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now be with me Erato,<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> and I will unfold who were the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kings, what the stage of circumstance, what the condition</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ancient Latium, when the stranger host first landed on <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonian shores, and will recall how the first blood was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drawn. Thou, goddess, thou prompt thy poet’s memory.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mine is a tale of grisly war, of battle array, and princes in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their fury rushing on carnage—of Tyrrhenian<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> ranks, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all Hesperia mustered in arms. Grander is the pile of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">events that rises on my view, grander the task I essay.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was the time when king Latinus, now stricken in age, was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ruling country and city in the calm of years of peace. He,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as story tells us, was the son of Faunus and a Laurentine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nymph, Marica. Faunus’ father was Picus, who owes his <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">birth to thee, great Saturn: thou art the first founder of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">line. No son, no male progeny, so Heaven willed, had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latinus now; just as it was budding into youth, the branch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was cut off. The sole maintainer of the race, the sole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">guardian of that princely house, was a daughter, already <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ripe for wedlock, already arrived at full-blown womanhood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many were her wooers from mighty Latium, nay, from all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonia. One wooer there was in beauty passing others,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> strong in the glory of sires and grandsires: his alliance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the queen with intense yearning was seeking to compass; <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but heavenly portents bar the way with manifold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alarm. There was a laurel in the middle of the palace, in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">very heart of royal privacy, sacred in its every leaf, cherished</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the awful observance of many years; men said that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father Latinus himself found it there when he first laid the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foundation of the tower, dedicated it to Phœbus, and thence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gave his new people the name of Laurentines. On the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">top of this tree lodged a dense swarm of bees, marvellous</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">to tell, sailing thither with loud humming noise across the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">liquid air, and twining their legs together, the cluster in a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moment was seen to hang from the leafy bough. At once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spoke a prophet: “There is a stranger approaching: I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see him now; along this self-same path a troop is moving <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hitherward, and commanding the height of the citadel.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moreover, while Lavinia is applying the hallowed torch to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the altars, as she stands in maiden purity at her father’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side, she was seen, oh, monstrous sight! to catch the fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with her long tresses, all her headgear consuming in the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crackling flame, her queenly hair, her jewelled coronal all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ablaze, till at last she was wrapt in smoke and yellow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glare, and scattered the fire-god’s sparks the whole palace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through. There indeed was a tale of horror, a marvel and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a portent; for, said the wise men, she will herself be illustrious <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in fame and fortune, but to the nation she bodes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tremendous war. Troubled by these prodigies, the king</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">repairs to the oracle of Faunus, his prophetic sire, to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">question at the groves beneath Albunea’s shade—that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queen of forests, ever vocal with the sacred waters, ever <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breathing from its dark heart deadly vaporous steam.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is here that the tribes of Italy and all Œnotrian land</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seek answers in their perplexity; hither the priestess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brings the inquirer’s offering, lies in the still of night on a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">couch of slaughtered sheep’s skins, and turns to sleep, when <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she sees many phantoms flitting in marvellous fashion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and hears divers voices, and enjoys communion with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gods, and holds converse with Acheron down in Avernus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deep. Here also king Latinus, in quest of an answer, was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sacrificing duly a hundred sheep of the second year, and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was lying on their skins, a fleecy bed, when sudden from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">depth of the grove an utterance was heard: “Look not to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ally your daughter in wedlock of Latium, O my son;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">put not faith in marriage chambers dressed and ready;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there are sons-in-law from a far country now on their way, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">men destined by mixing their blood with ours to exalt our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">name to the spheres—men whose lineal posterity shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one day look down and see under their feet the whole</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">world, far as the two oceans which the sun surveys in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">daily round, revolving beneath them and wielded by their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">control.” Such was the response of father Faunus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the counsel given at still of night: nor does Latinus hold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it shut in the prison of his own lips; but Fame had flown <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the rumour through Ausonia far and wide from city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to city, when the young chivalry of old Laomedon anchored</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their ships on the river’s grassy bank.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas and his chief captains, and Iulus young and fair,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lay their limbs to rest under the boughs of a lofty tree; <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there they spread the banquet, putting cakes of flour along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sward to support the food—such was Jove’s high inspiration—and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rearing on the wheaten foundation a pile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of wilding fruits. It chanced that when the rest was eaten,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the want of meat forced them to ply their tooth on those <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scanty gifts of Ceres—to profane with venturous hand and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mouth the sanctity of the cake’s fated circle, nor respect</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the square impressed on its surface. “What! eating our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tables<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> as well?” cries Iulus, in his merry vein; that and no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more. That utterance first told the hearers that their <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">toils were over: even as it fell from the boy’s mouth his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father caught it up and broke it short, wondering in himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the power of Heaven. Then anon: “Hail to thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">promised land of my destiny! hail to you,” he cries, “Troy’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">faithful gods! Yes, here is our home—this our country. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It was my father—these, I remember, were the mystic</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">words of fate he left me: ‘My son, whenever you are wafted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to an unknown coast, and hunger drives you, failing food,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to eat your tables, then remember my saying, there look</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for a home of rest, set up your first roof-tree and strengthen <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it with mound and rampart.’ This was the hunger he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">meant. This was the last strait in store for us, not the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beginning but the end of death. Come then, take heart,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and with the morrow’s earliest light explore we what is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the place, who its dwellers, where the city of the nation, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">making from the haven in different ways. Meanwhile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pour libations to Jove, invoke in prayer my sire Anchises,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and set again the wine on the board.” So having said, he</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreathes his brow with the leafy spray, and offers prayer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the genius of the spot; to Earth the eldest of the gods;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the nymphs and the streams yet unknown by name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">after that, to Night and Night’s new-born stars and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ida’s Jove, and Phrygia’s mighty mother, invoking each <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in turn, and his own two parents in the upper and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nether world. Just then the Almighty Father thundered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrice aloft in a clear sky, and with his own right hand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flashed in open view from on high a cloud ablaze with rays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of golden light. At once the news spreads among the Trojan <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranks that the day has arrived when they are to build</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their promised city. With emulous haste they celebrate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the banquet, and in the power of the august presage set on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bowls exultingly, and wreathe the wine.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as on the morrow the risen day began to illumine <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the earth with the first sparkle of her torch, some here,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">some there, they set about exploring the city, the frontiers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the seaboard of the country. This, they learn, is the spring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Numicius, this the river Tiber, this the home of the brave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latian race. Thereupon Anchises’ son commands an <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">embassy of a hundred, chosen from all classes alike, to go to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the monarch’s royal city, all of them with wreathed boughs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from Pallas’ tree, to carry presents for his honoured hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and entreat his friendship for the Teucrians. They delay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not, but hasten at his bidding, moving with rapid pace, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while he is marking out the city with a shallow trench,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">preparing the ground, and surrounding this their first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">settlement on the coast, camp-fashion, with battlements</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and earthworks. Meanwhile the missioned band had performed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their journey, and were in sight of the towers and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stately homes of Latium, and passing under the city wall.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a space before the town, boys and youths in their prime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are exercising on horseback, and breaking in their harnessed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cars among clouds of dust, or bending the sharp-springing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bow, or hurling from the arm the quivering javelin, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or vying on foot or with the gloves, when galloping up,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a messenger announces, in the aged monarch’s ears, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty men have arrived in strange attire. The king bids</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">him summon them into the presence-hall, and takes his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seat in the midst on his ancestral throne. It was a reverend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pile, of vast proportions, raised high upon a hundred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pillars, on the city’s topmost ground, the palace of Picus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Laurentine, clothed in the terror of waving woods and <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hereditary awe. Here it was held to be of auspicious presage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that kings should first take in hand the sceptre, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lift up the fasces: this temple was their senate-house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hall for their sacrificial feasts: here, when a ram was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slain, the seniors were wont to banquet down long lines <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of tables. Here, too, in succession were the effigies of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">past generations, carved from ancient cedar—Italus and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father Sabinus, planter of the vine, preserving in that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mimic form his curved hook, and hoary Saturn, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">image of two-faced Janus, all standing in the vestibule, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and other kings from the earliest days, and heroes who had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sustained the war-god’s wounds in fighting for their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">country. Moreover, there was hanging on the sacred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">doors abundance of armour, captive chariots, crooked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">axe-heads, helmet-crests, ponderous gates, javelins, and <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shields, and beaks torn from vessels. There, as in life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was sitting, decked with Quirinal staff and robe of scanty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">border, in his left hand the sacred shield, Picus, tamer of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the steed, he whom, in her bridal jealousy, Circe, by a stroke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of her golden rod and the witchery of her drugs, transformed <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to a bird, and scattered spots over his wings. Such was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the temple where Latinus, seated on his ancestral throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">summoned the Teucrians to his presence within, and on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their entry with placid mien bespoke them thus:—</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tell me, sons of Dardanus—for we know your city and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your race, and your coming over the deep has reached our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ears—what is your errand? what cause or what necessity</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has wafted your ships to our Ausonian coast through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those many leagues of blue water? Be it from ignorance of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">band of law, but by our own instinct and the rule of our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">parent-god. And now I remember, though years have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dulled the freshness of the tale, that aged Auruncans used</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to tell how in this land Dardanus saw the light, and hence <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he won his way to the towns of Phrygian Ida and Thracian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Samos, which men now call Samothrace. Ay, it was from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the house of Tuscan Corythus he went, and now the golden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">palace of starry heaven seats him on a throne, and among</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the altars of the gods makes room for him.” <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He ended; and Ilioneus followed thus: “Great king,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">illustrious son of Faunus, no stress of gloomy storm has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">made us the sport of the waves and driven us on your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coast, no sky or land misread has beguiled us of our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">track: of set purpose, with full intent, we are arrived one <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and all at your city, driven from a realm once the greatest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which the sun surveyed in his course from end to end of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven. From Jove is the origin of our race; in Jove, as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their ancestor, the sons of Dardanus glory; our monarch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself, sprung of Jove’s own pure blood, Æneas of Troy, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has sent us to your doors. How dire a hurricane, launched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from fell Mycenæ, swept over Ida’s plains—how the two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">worlds of Europe and Asia, fate driving each, met and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crashed together—has reached the ears of the man, if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">such there be, whom earth’s last corner withdraws from <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the wash of ocean, and his too who is parted from his fellows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the zone that lies midmost among the four, the zone of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the tyrannous sun. From the jaws of that deluge flying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over many and mighty waters, we ask of you for our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">country’s gods a narrow resting-place—the harmless <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">privilege of the coast, and the common liberty of water and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">air. We shall be no disgrace to your kingdom, nor light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall be the fame that men will blaze of you, nor shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gratitude for your great bounty grow old, nor shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonia mourn the day when she welcomed Troy to her <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heart. I swear by Æneas’ star, by his strong right hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">known as such by all who have proved it in friendship or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in war, many have been the peoples, many the nations—nay,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">scorn us not for that we accost you with fillets of suppliance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and words of prayer—who have sued for our company</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and wished to make us one with them. But the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oracles of heaven, speaking as they only can, have driven</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">us to search out your realms. Hence sprang Dardanus; <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hither Apollo bids us return, with the instance of high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">command, even to Tuscan Tiber and the sacred waters of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Numicius’ spring. Moreover, here are presents from Æneas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the scanty offerings of past prosperity, relics snatched from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the flames of Troy. From this gold his father, Anchises, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">poured libations at the altar; this was Priam’s royal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">accoutrement, when he gave laws in kingly fashion to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">assembled people; this sceptre, this sacred diadem, these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">robes, the work of Trojan dames.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus, as Ilioneus is speaking, Latinus holds his countenance <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in set downcast gaze, and sits rooted to his throne,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turning his eyes in intense thought. Nor does the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broidered purple stir his princely mind; no, nor the sceptre</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Priam, so deeply as he ponders on the wedlock, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bridal bed of his daughter, revolving in his breast old <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Faunus’ oracle. This must be that predicted son-in-law,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arrived from a foreign home, destined to reign in joint</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sovereignty with himself; thence must be born that glorious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">progeny, whose prowess is to master the world. At</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">length he breaks out in glad tones: “May the gods prosper <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our intent and ratify their own presage! Yes, Trojan,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you shall have your prayer, nor do I reject your presents.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Long as Latinus shall reign, you shall not lack the bounty of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a fruitful soil, nor miss the wealth of Troy. Let but Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself, if his desire of us is so great, if he covets the tie of <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hospitality and the style of alliance, come to our presence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor shrink from eyes that will view him kindly. Peace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will be incomplete till I have touched your monarch’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand. And now do you take back to your king this my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">message: I have a daughter, whose marriage with a husband <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of our nation is forbidden by voices from my father’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shrine, by countless prodigies from heaven; sons-in-law</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are to arrive from foreign climes—such, they say, is</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fate’s will for Latium—who by mixing their blood with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ours are to exalt our name to the spheres. That he is this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chosen one of destiny is my belief, and, if my mind reads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the future true, my award.” With these words the old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king makes choice of horses from the multitude he possessed. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Three hundred there were, sleek-coated, standing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in their lofty stalls. At once he bids his servants</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bring for each of the Teucrians a fleet-foot with housings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of embroidered purple; golden poitrels hang down to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chest of each; there is gold on their coverings; yellow <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold under their champing teeth. For the absent Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he orders a car and two coursers of ethereal seed, snorting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fire from their nostrils, sprung of that brood which artful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Circe raised up fraudfully to her father the Sun, a spurious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">race, from the womb of a mortal dam. Thus graced with <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gifts and kind speeches, the children of Æneas journey</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">homeward on their tall steeds, and carry tidings of peace.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile, there was Jove’s relentless spouse travelling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back from her own Argos, city of Inachus, and already</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">launched on mid air; looking from the sky over Sicilian <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pachynus, she beheld in distant prospect Æneas in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hour of joy and the Dardan fleet. Already she sees him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">building his home; already he has made the soil his friend,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and has parted from his ships. Pierced with bitter grief,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she stayed her course, and then, shaking her head, pours <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from her heart words like these: “Ah, that hated stock!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those destinies of Phrygia that hold my destinies in check!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Did the dead really fall on the plains of Sigeum? were the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">captives captured in truth? did the flames of Troy burn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the men of Troy? Through the heart of the battle, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the heart of the fire they have found a way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ay, belike, my power at last lies gasping and spent; my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hatred is slaked and I am at peace. I, who followed them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a foe’s zeal over the water even when tossed from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their country’s arms, and met the exiles front to front on <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">every sea! Spent on these Teucrians is all that sky and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">surge can do. Have Syrtes, has Scylla, has Charybdis’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yawning gulf stood me aught in stead? They have</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">gained the channel of Tiber, the haven of their wishes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and may laugh at ocean and at me. Mars had strength to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">destroy the Lapithan nation, huge as they were; the father</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the gods gave up the honoured land of Calydon to Diana’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vengeance; and what had Lapithans or Calydon done <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to earn such penal ruin? But I, Jove’s great consort,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who have stooped, miserably stooped, to leave nothing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">untried, who have assumed every form by turns, am vanquished</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by Æneas. Well, if my power be not august</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enough, I would not shrink from suing for other aid, be it <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">found where it may; if I cannot prevail above, I will stir</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up the fiends of the deep. It will not be mine to keep him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the crown of Latium—be it so; fixed for him by fate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unalterably is his bride Lavinia; but delays and impediments</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may well be where the matter is so great; but to <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cut off the subjects of our two monarchs—this may be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">done. So let father and son-in-law embrace, at the cost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of their people’s lives. The blood of Trojan and Rutulian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall be your dower, fair lady; Bellona<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> is waiting to lead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you to your chamber. Nor is Hecuba the only mother that <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has teemed with a fire-brand and given birth to a nuptial</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blaze; Venus sees the tale repeated in her own offspring—a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">second Paris—a funeral torch rekindled for reviving</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Having vented words like these, she flew down in black <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rage to the earth; and now she summons Allecto<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> the baleful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the dwelling of the dread goddesses and the darkness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the pit—Allecto, whom bitter wars, and strifes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and stratagems, and injurious crimes cheer like a cordial.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hateful even to Pluto her sire is the fiend, hateful to her <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tartarean sisters, so many the forms she puts on, so terrible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the mien of each, so countless the vipers that burgeon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blackly from her head. Her, thus dreadful, Juno lashes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to fiercer fury, speaking on this wise: “Grant me, maiden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">daughter of Night, a boon all my own—thine undivided <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aid, that my praise and renown may not be dashed from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their pedestal—that the children of Æneas may not be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">able to ensnare Latinus in a bridal alliance or beset the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italian frontier. Thou canst make brothers of one soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">take arms and fight; canst make peaceful homes dens of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strife; thou canst gain entrance for the scourge and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">funeral torch: thou hast a thousand names, a thousand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">means of ill. Stir up that prolific bosom, snap the formed <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bands of peace, scatter the incentives of war, let the nation</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the same moment desire, demand, and seize the sword.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So then Allecto, empoisoned with Gorgon venom, first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">repairs to Latium and the lofty halls of the Laurentine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">monarch, and sits down before the hushed chamber of <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queen Amata,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> who, as she mused on the arrival of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trojans and Turnus’ bridal hopes, was glowing and seething</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with all a woman’s passion, a woman’s spleen. Snatching</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a snake from her dark venomed locks, she hurls it at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her, and lodges it in the bosom close to the very heart, that, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">maddened by the pest, she may drive the whole house wild.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In glides the reptile unfelt, winding between the robe and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the marble breast, and beguiles her into frenzy, breathing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into her lungs its viperous breath; the linked gold round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her neck turns to the monstrous serpent; so does the festoon <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of her long fillet; it twines her hair, it slides smoothly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from limb to limb. And while the first access of contagion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stealing in with clammy poison, is pervading her senses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and threading her bones with flame, ere yet the soul has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">caught fire through the whole compass of the bosom, she <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">speaks with gentle plaint, as mothers wont, shedding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">many tears over her child and the Phrygian alliance: “And</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are fugitives from Troy to take Lavinia in marriage, good</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father? have you no compassion for your daughter and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yourself? none for her mother, whom with the first fair <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gale the faithless pirate will leave and make for the deep,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carrying off his maiden prey? Ay, things were not so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when the Phrygian shepherd stole into Lacedæmon, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bore away Leda’s Helen to Troy town. Where is your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pledged faith? where your old tenderness for your own <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blood, and your hand plighted so oft to your kinsman</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus? If Latian folk must have a son-in-law fetched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from a foreign stock, and this is unalterably fixed, and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">your father Faunus’ command sits heavy on your soul, I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hold that every nation is foreign whose independence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">severs it from our rule, and that such is Heaven’s intent.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus, too, if you go back to the first foundation of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">house, has Inachus and Acrisius for his ancestors, and the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heart of Mycenæ for his home.” But when, having tried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in vain what these words can do, she sees Latinus obstinately</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bent, and meantime the serpent’s fiendish mischief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has sunk deep into her vitals, and is thrilling every</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vein, then at last the miserable queen, unsexed by the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">portentous enormity, raves in ungoverned frenzy through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the city’s length and breadth; as oft you may see a top</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spinning under the lash, which boys are flogging round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and round in a great ring in an empty courtyard, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">every thought on their game: driven by the whip it <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keeps making circle after circle: the beardless faces</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hang over it in puzzled wonder, marvelling how the box-wood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">can fly, as though the blows made it a living thing.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With motion as furious she courses through crowded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">streets and unruly peoples. Nay, more than this, she <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">feigns the inspiration of Bacchus, nerving herself to more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">atrocious deeds, and climbing new heights of madness—flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into the woods, and hides her daughter among the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leafy hills, all to snatch from the Teucrians the bridal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bed and delay the kindling of Hymen’s torch. “Evoe <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bacchus!” is her cry; “thou, and none but thou art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fit mate for a maid like this. See! for thee she takes up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sacred wand, for thee she leads the dance, for thee she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grows her dedicated hair.” Fame flies abroad; other</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mothers are instinct with frenzy, and all have the same <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mad passion driving them to seek a new home. They</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have left their houses, and are spreading hair and shoulders</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the wind; while some are filling the sky with quivering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shrieks, clad in fawn-skins, and carrying vine-branch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spears. There in the middle is the queen all aglow, lifting <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">high a blazing pine, and singing the bridal song of Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and her daughter, her eye red and glaring; and sudden she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shouts like a savage: “Ho! mothers of Latium all, where’er</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">ye be, if ye have human hearts and kindness left there for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">poor Amata, if ye are stung to think of a mother’s rights,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">off with the fillets from your hair, and join the orgie with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me.” Such is the queen, driven among the woods, among</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the wild beasts’ lairs far and wide, by Bacchus’ goad in <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Allecto’s hand.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now, judging that she had barbed enough the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">young fangs of frenzy, upheaving from their bases the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">royal purpose and the royal house, the grim goddess next</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soars in air on her murky wings on to the walls of the bold <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulian, the city which they say Danae built for her Argive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">settlers, landing there under stress of wind. Ardea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was the name which past generations gave the place, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ardea still keeps her august title; but her star is set,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus at deep of night was in <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the midst of his sleep. Allecto puts off her hideous features</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and her fiendish shape, transforms herself to an old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">woman’s countenance and furrows her loathly brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with wrinkles, assumes hoary locks and woollen fillet,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lastly twines them with an olive spray, and so becomes <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Calybe, the aged priestess of Juno’s temple; and presents</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">herself to the young warrior’s eyes with such words as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these: “And can Turnus calmly see all his toils poured out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in vain, and the crown that is his own transferred to settlers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from Dardania? See, the king is refusing you your bride <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and your blood-bought dowry, and search is being made for</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, let king Latinus, unless he consent to give you your</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Laughing scornfully at the old seer, the youth thus spoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in reply: “The news that a fleet has arrived in the Tiber</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has not, as you imagine, escaped my ear. Conjure me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no such mighty terrors, nor think that queen Juno has forgotten</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me. No, it is you, good mother, whom mouldering <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dotage, drained dry of truth, is vexing to no end, mocking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your prophetic soul with false alarms in an atmosphere of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">royal armaments. You are in your place watching over</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">statues and temples; but war and peace must be wielded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by men, whose work war is.” <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At these words Allecto kindled into wrath. Even in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the act of speaking a shudder seized the youth’s frame and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his eyes grew stiff and stony, so fierce the hissing of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fury’s thousand snakes, so monstrous the features that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rose on his view. Instant with a roll of her fiery orbs she <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrust him back as he faltered and tried to speak further;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on either brow she upreared a serpent lock, and cracked her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whip, and with infuriate lips followed thus: “Here is the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mouldering mother, whom dotage, drained dry of truth, is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mocking with false alarms in an atmosphere of royal armaments. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn your eyes hither; I am come from the dwelling</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">this hand.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Saying thus, she hurled a torch full at the youth, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lodged in his breast the pine-wood with its lurid smoke and <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glare. The bonds of sleep are broken by the giant terror,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a burst of sweat all over bathes the whole man, bone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and limb. “My sword!” he screams in frenzy; for his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword he searches pillow and palace: the fever of the steel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the guilty madness of bloodshed rage within him, and angry <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pride tops all: even as when loud-crackling a fire of sticks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is heaped round the sides of a waving caldron, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heat makes the water start; there within is the flood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steaming and storming, and bubbling high in froth, till at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">last the wave cannot contain itself, and the black vapour <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flies up into the air. So then, trampling on treaties, he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gives the word to the chiefs of his soldiery for a march</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">upon King Latinus, and bids arms be got ready. Italy</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">must be protected, the foe must be driven from the frontier;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he and his men will be enough for both, Teucrians and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latians. So he says and appeals to Heaven: and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulians with emulous zeal encourage each other to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fight. This one is fired by his leader’s peerless beauty <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and youth; this by the kings in his pedigree; this by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glorious deeds of his hand.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While Turnus is filling the Rutulians with the spirit of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">daring, Allecto is putting her infernal wings in motion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against the Teucrians. A new device working in her <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mind, she fixed her eye on the spot where on the winding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coast Iulus was hunting game with the snare and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course. Hereon the maiden of Cocytus suddenly presents</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the hounds a maddening lure, and touches their nostrils</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the scent they know so well, making them chase a <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stag in full cry; which was the first origin of the trouble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and put the spark of war to the spirit of the countryside.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There was a stag of beauteous form and lofty horns,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">taken by the sons of Tyrrheus from its mother’s breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and brought up by them and their father Tyrrheus, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who had the control of the royal herds and the charge of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole range of lawn. Trained to obey, it was the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chief care of their sister Silvia; she would deck and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreathe its horns with delicate festoons, and comb its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rough coat, and wash it in the clear stream. Grown tame <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the hand, and accustomed to its master’s table, it would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">run free in the forest and take itself back home to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">well-known door, however late the night. Now, in one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of its wanderings the maddened hounds of Iulus started</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it in the hunt, as it happened to be floating down the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stream or allaying its heat on the verdant bank. Ascanius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself, fired with a proud ambition, bent his bow and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">levelled a shaft: nor did his hand err for want of heavenly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aid: the reed sped with a loud hurtling sound and pierced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the belly and the flank. The wounded creature took refuge <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under the roof it knew, and moaning crept into its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stall, and bleeding all over filled, like a human suppliant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the house with its piteous plaints. Sister Silvia first,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">smiting on her arms with her flat hands, calls for help and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">summons the rough country folk. They—for the fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fiend is lurking in the silence of the forest—are at her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side ere she looks for them, armed one with a seared brand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one with a heavy knotted stock: what each first finds as he <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gropes about, anger makes do weapon’s service. Tyrrheus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">musters the company, just as the news found him, splitting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an oak in four with convergent wedges, catching up an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">axe and breathing savage rage. But the cruel goddess,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seizing from her watch-tower the moment of mischief, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">makes for the stall’s lofty roof, and from its summit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shrills forth the shepherd’s clarion, pitching high on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreathen horn her Tartarean note; at the sound the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whole line of forest was convulsed, and the woods echoed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to their depths: it was heard far off by Trivia’s[246] lake, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heard by river Nar[246] with his whitening sulphurous waters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and by the springs of the Veline<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>: and terror-stricken</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mothers clasped their children to their breasts.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At once running to the sound with which the dread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clarion gave the signal, the untamed rustics snatch up <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their weapons and gather from all sides; while the forces</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Troy, on their part, pour through the camp’s open gates</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their succour for Ascanius. It is no longer a woodman’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quarrel waged with heavy clubs or seared stakes; they try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the issue with two-edged steel; a dark harvest of drawn <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swords bristles over the field; the brass shines responsive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the sun’s challenge, and flings its radiance skyward; as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when the wave has begun to whiten under the rising wind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the ocean gradually upheaves itself, and raises its billows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">higher and higher, till at last, from its lowest depths, it <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mounts up to heaven. See! as the arrow whizzes, a young</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warrior in the first rank, once Tyrrheus’ eldest born, Almo,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is laid low in death; for the wound has lodged in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">throat, and has cut off, with the rush of blood, the passage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the liquid voice and the vital breath. Round him lie <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">many gallant frames, and among them old Galæsus, while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">throwing himself between the armies and pleading for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">peace; none so just as he, none so wealthy before to-day in</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonian land; five flocks of sheep had he, five herds of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oxen went to and fro from his stalls, and his land was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">furrowed by a hundred ploughs.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While thus on the plains the impartial war-god deals out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fortune, the goddess, having achieved her promise, soon <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as she had inaugurated the war with blood, and brought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the battle to its first murderous shock, flies from Hesperia,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and rounding the cope of heaven, addresses Juno in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">haughty tones of triumph: “See here the work of discord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">complete in the horrors of war! Now bid them come together <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in friendship and strike truce. Thou hast seen that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I can sprinkle the Trojans with Ausonian blood; let me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but be assured of thy wish, I will give thee a further boon:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will sew rumours and bring the neighbouring cities into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the war, and inflame their souls with mad martial passion <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to crowd from all sides with succour; I will scatter arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broadcast.” Juno returns: “There is panic and treachery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enough; the seeds of war are sown deep; men are fighting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand to hand; the weapons which chance first supplied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are being seasoned with new-spilt blood. Such be the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alliance, such the nuptial rites solemnized by Venus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">virtuous son and good king Latinus. For thee to walk the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">upper air with larger freedom would displease the great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father, the monarch of high Olympus. Give place; should</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">any chance emerge in the struggle, myself will deal with it.” <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So spoke Saturn’s daughter: the Fury lifts her wings that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hurtle with serpent plumage, and seeks her home in Cocytus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaving the altitudes above. There is a place in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bosom of Italy, under the shadow of lofty hills, known to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fame and celebrated in far-off lands, the vale of Amsanctus; <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pent between two woody slopes, dark with dense foliage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while at the bottom a broken torrent makes a roaring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among the rocks along its winding bed. Here men show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an awful cavern, the very gorge of the fell infernal god, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a deep gulf through which Acheron breaks open its baleful <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mouth: there dived the Fury, and relieved of her loathed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presence earth and heaven.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile, for her part, Saturn’s royal daughter gives</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">the last touch that brings down the war. From the battle-field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there pours into the city the whole company of shepherds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with their slain in their arms, young Almo and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Galæsus’ disfigured countenance, calling on the gods and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">adjuring Latinus. Turnus is on the spot, and, in the fury <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and fire of the blood-cry, sounds again and again the note</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of terror: “The Teucrians are invited to reign in Latium;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a Phrygian shoot is to be grafted on the royal tree; the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">palace-gate is closed on himself.” Moreover, the kinsmen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the matrons, who in Bacchic madness are footing the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pathless woods—for Amata’s name weighs not lightly—muster</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from all sides, and strain the throat of Mars to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hoarseness. All at once, defying omens and oracles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under the spell of a cursed deity, they clamour for an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">atrocious war. With emulous zeal they swarm round <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latinus’ palace; he, like a rock in the sea, stands unshaken;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like a rock in the sea before the rush and crash of waters,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which, amid, thousands of barking waves, is fixed by its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own weight; the crags and the spray-foamed stones</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">roar about it in vain, and the lashed seaweed falls idly <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from its side. But when he finds no power given him to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">counterwork the secret agency, and all is moving at relentless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Juno’s beck, then with many an appeal to the gods</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the soulless skies, “Alas!” exclaims the good sire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“shattered are we by destiny and whirled before the storm! <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On you will come the reckoning, and your impious blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will pay it, my wretched children! You, Turnus, you will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be met by your crime and its fearful vengeance, in a day</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when it will be too late to pray to Heaven. For me, my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rest is assured; my ship is just dropping into port; it is <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but of a happy departure that I am robbed.” No more</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he spoke, but shut himself in an inner chamber, and let</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the reins of empire go.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A custom there was in the Hesperian days of Latium,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">observed as sacred in succession by the Alban cities, and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now honoured by the observance of Rome, the greatest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">power on earth, when men first stir up the war-god to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle, whether their purpose be to carry piteous war</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">among the Getæ, the Hyrcanians, or the Arabs, or to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">march as far as India, track the Morning-star to its home,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and wrest the standards from the grasp of Parthia.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There are two folding-gates of War—such the title they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bear—clothed with religious awe and with the terrors of <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mars the cruel: they are closed by a hundred brazen bars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and by the everlasting strength of iron, and Janus<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quits his guard on the threshold. When the fathers finally</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conclude for battle, the consul himself, in the pride of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Quirinus’ striped robe and the Gabine<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> cincture, unbars the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grating portals, and with his own voice invokes battle;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rest of the warriors take up the cry, and brazen horns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blare out in unison their hoarse assent. Thus it was that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then, too, Latinus was urged to declare war against the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">family of Æneas and to unclose the grim gates. The good <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">old king recoiled from the touch, turned with averted eyes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the service he loathed, and shrouded himself in impenetrable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gloom. Then darted down from the sky the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queen of heaven, smote with her own royal hand the unwilling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">portals, and from their bursten fastenings, as Saturn’s <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">daughter might, flung back the valves on their hinges.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All Ausonia, sluggish and moveless till then, blazes into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fury; some commence their footmarch over the plain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">some from the height of their steeds storm through the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dust; one and all cry out for arms. Some are rubbing their <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shields smooth and their javelins bright with unctuous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lard, and putting their axes under the grindstone; there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is joy in the carrying of the standard, joy in the hearing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the trumpet’s sound. And now there are five great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cities with anvils everywhere set up, giving a new edge to <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their weapons: Atina the mighty and Tibur the proud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ardea, and they of Crustumium, and tower-crowned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Antemnæ. Helmets are hollowed to guard the head;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">willows are twisted into wicker frames for shields; others</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are beating out brass into breastplates, or stretching ductile <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">silver into polished greaves. All the pride of sickle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and share, all the passion for the plough are swallowed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up in this; they bring out their father’s swords, and smelt</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">them anew in the furnace. Here, in wild haste, is one</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snatching his helm from the chamber-wall; there is another</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bringing his snorting steeds to the yoke, clothing</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">stretched himself on the bank under heaven’s chilly cope,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and let repose at last steal over his frame. Before him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">appeared in person the god of the place, old Tiber of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pleasant stream, rising among the poplar foliage: a gray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mantle of transparent linen floated about him, and his <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hair was shaded with bushy reeds: and thus he began to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">address the chief and relieve his care: “O offspring of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven’s stock, who are bringing back to us safe from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the foe the city of Troy, and preserving Pergamus in enduring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">life, yourself looked for long on the Laurentian <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soil and in the fields of Latium, here is your abiding place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of rest, here, distrust it not, permanence for your home-gods:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">let not war’s threatenings make you afraid, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swellings of the anger of heaven have all given way.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even now, that you may not think this the idle coinage <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of sleep, under the oaks on the bank you shall find an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enormous swine lying with a litter of thirty head just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">born, white herself throughout her lazy length, her children</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round her breasts as white as she: a sign that when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thirty years have made their circuit, Ascanius shall found <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that city known by the illustrious name of the White.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of no doubtful issue are these words of mine. Now for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the way in which you may triumphantly unravel the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">present knot, grant me your attention, and I will show</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you in brief. On this my coast, Arcadians, a race sprung <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from Pallas, who have followed king Evander and his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">banner, have chosen themselves a site and built a city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the hills, called from the name of their ancestor Pallas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallanteum. These are forever engaged in war with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latian nation: let them join your camp as allies, and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">make league with them. I myself will lead you between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the banks, straight along my stream, that as you journey</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up your oars may surmount the adverse current. Up</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then, goddess-born, and ere the stars have well set, offer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prayer in due course to Juno, and overbear with suppliant <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vows her anger and her menace. Once triumphant,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you shall pay your worship to me. I am he whom you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see here with brimming flood grazing the banks and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">threading rich cultured lands, sea-green Tiber, the river</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whom gods love best. Here rises my royal palace, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crown of lofty cities.” The river-god said, and plunged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into his deep pool, down to the bottom; night and sleep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at once fled from Æneas. He rises, and with his eyes <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fixed on the sun’s rays just dawning on the sky, he lifts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up in due form water from the river in the hollow of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his hands, and pours forth to heaven words like these:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nymphs, Laurentian nymphs, whence rivers derive their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">birth, and thou, father Tiber, with thy hallowed flood, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">take Æneas to your bosom, and at last relieve him from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">perils. Whatever the spring of the pool where thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dwellest in thy pity for our troubles, whatever the soil</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whence thy goodly stream arises, ever shalt thou be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">honoured by me with sacrifice, ever with offerings, the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">river with the crescent horn, the monarch of Hesperian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">waters. Be but thou present, and confirm by thy deed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy heavenly tokens.” So saying, he chooses two biremes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the fleet and fits them with rowers, while he gives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his comrades arms to wear. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When lo, a sudden portent marvellous to view—stretched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in milk-white length along the sward, herself of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one hue with her white litter, conspicuous on the verdant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bank is seen a sow, whom pious Æneas to thee, even to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thee, mightiest Juno, immolates in sacrifice, and sets her <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with all her brood before the altar. That whole night</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long Tiber smoothed his brimming stream, and so stood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with hushed waves, half recoiling, as to lay down a watery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">floor as of some gentle lake or peaceful pool, that the oar</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">might have nought to struggle with. So they begin their <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">voyage and speed with auspicious cheers. Smooth along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the surface floats the anointed pine: marvelling stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the waters, marvelling the unwonted wood, to see the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warriors’ shields gleaming far along the stream, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">painted vessels gliding between the banks. The rowers <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give no rest to night or day, as they surmount the long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">meanders, sweep under the fringe of diverse trees, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cut through the woods that look green in the still expanse.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The sun had climbed in full blaze the central cope of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven, when from afar they see walls, and a citadel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the roofs of straggling habitations—the place which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the power of Rome has now made to mate the skies:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then it was but Evander’s poor domain. At once they <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turn their prows to land and approach the town.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">It happened that on that day the Arcadian monarch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was performing a yearly sacrifice to Amphitryon’s mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">child<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> and the heavenly brotherhood in a grove before the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city. With him his son Pallas, with him all the prime of <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his warriors and his unambitious senate were offering incense,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the new-shed blood was steaming warm on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">altar. Soon as they saw tall ships gliding toward them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the shadowy trees, and plying the oar in silence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">alarmed by the sudden apparition, each and all start up <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the sacrificial board. Pallas, bolder than the rest,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bids them not break the sacred observance, and snatching</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up a weapon flies himself to meet the strangers, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from a height at distance, “Warriors,” he cries, “what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cause has led you to venture on a path you know not? <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whither are you bound? what is your nation, your family?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is it peace you bring us or war?” Then father Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bespeaks him thus from the lofty stern, stretching forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in his hand a branch of peaceful olive: “These are Trojans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you see. These weapons mean hostility to the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latins, who have driven us from their land by a tyrannous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war. Our errand is to Evander. Take back our message,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and say that chosen chiefs of Dardany are at his gate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">praying for an armed alliance.” That mighty name</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">struck awe into Pallas. “Disembark,” he cries, “whoever <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you be, and speak to my sire in person, and come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beneath our home-gods’ hospitable shelter,” and gave his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand in welcome, and clung to the hand he clasped.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They advance under the shade of the grove, and leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the river behind. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Æneas addresses the king with friendly courtesy:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Best of the sons of Greece, to whom it has pleased Fortune</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that I should make my prayer and stretch out boughs</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreathed with fillets, I felt no fear for that you were a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Danaan leader, an Arcadian, allied by lineage with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">two sons of Atreus: I felt that my own worth, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gods’ hallowed oracles, and the old connection of our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancestry, and your world-wide fame, had linked me to <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you, and brought me before you at once by destiny and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of my own will. Dardanus, first father and founder of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town of Ilion, born, as Greeks tell, of Electra, daughter of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Atlas, came among Teucer’s people: Electra’s father was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty Atlas, he that bears up on his shoulders the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spheres of heaven. Your progenitor is Mercury, whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beauteous Maia<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> conceived and brought forth on Cyllene’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chill summit; but Maia, if tradition be credited, is the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">child of Atlas, the same Atlas who lifts up the stars of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the firmament. Thus our two races part off from one <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the same stock. Trusting to this, I sent no embassy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor contrived the first approaches to you by rule</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and method: in myself, in my own person, I have made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the experiment, and come to your gate as a suppliant.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The same tribe which persecutes you, the Daunians, is <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now persecuting us with cruel war: should they drive us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">away, they foresee nought to hinder their subduing all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hesperia utterly to their yoke, and mastering either sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that washes it above or below. Take our friendship and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give us yours. On our side are hearts valiant in war, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a gallant youth approved by adventure.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas ended. Long ere this the other’s eye was scanning</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the speaker’s countenance and eyes, and surveying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his whole frame. Then he returns in brief: “With what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">joy, bravest of the Teucrians, do I welcome and acknowledge <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ye! how well I call to mind the words, the voice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the look of your sire, the great Anchises! For I remember</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">how Priam, son of Laomedon, journeying to Salamis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to see the kingdom of his sister Hesione, went on to visit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the chill frontier of Arcadia. In those days the first <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bloom of youth was clothing my cheeks. I admired the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teucrian leaders, I admired Laomedon’s royal son; but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anchises’ port was nobler than all. My mind kindled</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a youth’s ardour to accost one so great, and exchange</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the grasp of the hand. I made my approach, and eagerly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conducted him to the walls of Pheneus.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> On leaving he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gave me a beauteous quiver with Lycian arrows, and a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scarf embroidered with gold, and two bridles which my <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallas has now, all golden. So now I both plight you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here with the hand you ask, and soon as to-morrow’s light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall restore to the earth its blessing, I will send you back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rejoicing in an armed succour, and reënforced with stores.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile, since you are arrived here as my friends, join <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in gladly solemnizing with us this our yearly celebration,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which it were sin to postpone, and accustom yourselves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus early to the hospitalities of your new allies.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This said, he bids set on again the viands and the cups,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">erewhile removed, and himself places the warriors on a <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seat of turf, welcoming Æneas in especial grace with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaped cushion of a shaggy lion’s hide, and bidding him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">occupy a throne of maple wood. Then chosen youths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the priest of the altar with emulous zeal bring in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">roasted carcases of bulls, pile up in baskets the gifts of <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the corn-goddess prepared by art, and serve the wine-god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round. Æneas and the warriors of Troy with him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">regale themselves on a bull’s long chine<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> and on sacrificial</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">entrails.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When hunger had been quenched and appetite allayed, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king Evander begins: “Think not that these solemnities</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ours, these ritual feastings, this altar so blest in divine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presence, have been riveted on us by idle superstition,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unknowing of the gods of old; no, guest of Troy, it is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deliverance from cruel dangers that makes us sacrifice <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and pay again and again worship where worship is due.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First of all cast your eyes on this rock-hung crag: observe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">how the masses of stone are flung here and there, how</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">desolate and exposed stands the mountain’s recess, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">how the rocks have left the trail of a giant downfall. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here once was a cave, retiring in enormous depth, tenanted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by a terrible shape, Cacus, half man, half brute: the sun’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rays could never pierce it; the ground was always steaming</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">with fresh carnage; fixed to its imperious portals</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were hanging human countenances ghastly with hideous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gore. This monster’s father was Vulcan: Vulcan’s were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the murky fires that he disgorged from his mouth as he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">towered along in enormous bulk. To us also at length <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in our yearning need time brought the arrival of a divine</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">helper. For the mightiest of avengers, Alcides, triumphing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the slaughter and the spoils of the triple Geryon,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was in our land, and was driving by this road as a conqueror</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those giant oxen, and the cattle were filling valley <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and river-side. But Cacus, infatuated by fiendish frenzy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not to leave aught of crime or craft undared or unessayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carries off from the stalls four bulls of goodly form, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heifers no fewer of surpassing beauty. And these, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they might leave no traces by their forward motion, he <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dragged by the tail to his cave, haled them with reversed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">footprints to tell the story, and so concealed them in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dark rocky den. Thus the seeker found no traces to lead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him to the cavern. Meantime, when Amphitryon’s son</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was at last removing from their stalls his feasted herds <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and preparing to quit the country, the oxen gave a farewell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">low, filling the whole woodland with their plainings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and taking clamorous leave of the hills. One of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heifers returned the sound, lowing from the depth of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vast cavern, and thus baffled the hopes of her jealous <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">guardian. Now, if ever, Alcides’ wrath blazed up from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the black choler of his heart: he snatches up his weapons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his club with all its weight of knots, and makes at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">full speed for the skyey mountain’s height. Then first the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">men of our country saw Cacus’ limbs tremble and his <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eyes quail: away he flies swifter than the wind, and seeks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his den; fear has winged his feet. Scarce had he shut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself in, and let down from its burst fastenings the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">huge stone, suspended there by his father’s workmanship</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in iron, and with that barrier fortified his straining doorway, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when lo! the hero of Tiryns<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> was there in the fury</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of his soul: scanning every inlet he turns his face hither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and thither, gnashing with his teeth. Thrice in white</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">heat of wrath he surveys the whole mass of Aventine;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrice he attempts in vain the stony portal; thrice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">staggering from the effort, he sits down in the hollow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Before him stood a pointed crag with abrupt rocky sides</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rising over the cave behind, high as the eye can reach, a <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fitting home for the nests of unclean and hateful birds.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This, as sloping down it inclined towards the river on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left, pushing it full on the right he upheaved and tore it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loose from its seat, then suddenly sent it down, with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shock at which high heaven thunders, the banks start <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">apart, and the river runs back in terror. Then the cave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the vast halls of Cacus were seen unroofed, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dark recesses lay open to their depths—even as if earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by some mighty force laid open to her depths, should</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">burst the doors of the mansions below, and expose the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">realms of ghastly gloom which the gods hate, and from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">above the vast abyss were to be seen, and the spectres</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dazzled by the influx of day. So as Cacus stares surprised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the sudden burst of light, pent by the walls of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his cave, and roars in strange and hideous sort, Alcides <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from above showers down his darts, and calls every</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapon to his aid, and rains a tempest of boughs and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">huge millstones. But he, seeing that no hope of flight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">remains, vomits from his throat huge volumes of smoke,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">marvellous to tell, and wraps the whole place in pitchy <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">darkness, blotting out all prospect from the eyes, and in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the depth of the cave masses a smothering night of blended</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blackness and fire. The rage of Alcides brooked not this:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">headlong he dashed through the flame, where the smoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">surges thickest and the vast cavern seethes with billows <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of black vapour. Here while Cacus in the heart of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gloom is vomiting his helpless fires he seizes him, twines</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his limbs with his own, and in fierce embrace compresses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his strangled eyeballs and his throat now bloodless and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dry. At once the doors are burst and the black den laid <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bare, and the plundered oxen, the spoil that his oath had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">disclaimed, are exposed to light, and the hideous carcase</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is dragged out by the heels. The gazers look unsatisfied</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">on those dreadful eyes, those grim features, the shaggy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breast of the half bestial monster, and the extinguished</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">furnace of his throat. Since then grateful acknowledgments</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have been paid, and the men of younger time have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">joyfully observed the day: foremost among them Potitius, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">founder of the ceremony, and the Pinarian house, custodian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the worship of Hercules. He himself set up in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the grove this altar, which shall ever be named by us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the greatest, and shall ever be the greatest in truth.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come then, warriors, and in honour of worth so glorious <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreathe your locks with leaves, and present in your hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brimming cups, and invoke our common deity, and pour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">libations with gladness of heart.” As he ended, the white-green</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">poplar cast its Herculean shade over his locks and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hung down with a festoon of leaves, and the sacred goblet <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">charged his hand. At once all with glad hearts pour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">libations on the board and make prayers to heaven.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime evening is approaching nearer the slope of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven, and already the priests and their chief Potitius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were in procession, clad in skins in ritual sort, and bearing <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fire in their hands. They renew the solemn feast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and bring delicious offerings for a fresh repast, and pile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the altars with loaded chargers. Then come the Salii to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sing round about the blazing altars, their temples wreathed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with boughs of poplar, a company of youths and another <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of old men; and these extol in song the glories and deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Hercules: how in his cradle, by the pressure of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">young hand he strangled his stepmother’s monstrous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">messengers, the two serpents; how in war that same</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand dashed to pieces mighty cities, Troy and Œchalia; <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">how he endured those thousand heavy labours, a slave to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king Eurystheus, by ungentle Juno’s fateful will. “Yes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thou, unconquered hero, thou slayest the two-formed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">children of the cloud, Hylæus and Pholus, thou slayest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the portent of Crete, and the enormous lion that dwelt <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’neath Nemea’s rock. Thou never quailedst at aught in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bodily shape, no, nor at Typhœus himself, towering high,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapons in hand; thy reason failed thee not when Lerna’s</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">serpent stood round thee with all her throng of heads.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hail to thee, authentic offspring of Jove, fresh ornament</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the sky! come to us, come to these thine own rites</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with favouring smile and auspicious gait.” Such things</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their songs commemorate; and they crown all with Cacus’ <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cave and the fiend himself, the fire panting from his lungs.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The entire grove echoes with their voices, and the hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rebound.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The sacrifice over, the whole concourse returns to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city. There walked the king, mossed over with years, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keeping at his side Æneas and his son as he moved along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and lightening the way with various speech. Æneas admires,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and turns his quick glance from sight to sight:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each scene enthralls him; and with eager zest he inquires</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and learns one by one the records of men of old. Then <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spoke king Evander, the builder of Rome’s tower-crowned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hill: “These woodlands were first inhabited by native</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fauns and Nymphs, and by a race of men that sprung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from trunks of trees and hard oaken core; no rule of life,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no culture had they: they never learnt to yoke the ox, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor to hive their stores, nor to husband what they got;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the boughs and the chase supplied their savage sustenance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The first change came from Saturn, who arrived from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">skyey Olympus, flying from the arms of Jove, a realmless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">exile. He brought together the race, untamed as they <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were and scattered over mountain heights, and gave them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">laws, and chose for the country the name of Latium,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">because he had found it a safe hiding-place. The golden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">age of story was when he was king, so calm and peaceful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his rule over his people; till gradually there crept in a <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">race of worse grain and duller hue, and the frenzy of war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the greed of having. Then came the host of Ausonia</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Sicanian tribes, and again and again Saturn’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">land changed its name; then came king after king, savage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thybris with his giant bulk, from whom in after days we <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italians called the river Tiber: the authentic name of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancient Albula was lost. Myself, an exile from my country,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while voyaging to the ends of the sea, all-powerful</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune and inevitable Destiny planted here; at my back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were the awful hests<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> of my mother, the nymph Carmentis,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the divine sanction of Apollo.” Scarce had he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">finished, when moving on he points out the altar and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Carmental gate, as the Romans call it, their ancient <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tribute to the nymph Carmentis, the soothsaying seer, who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">first told of the future greatness of Æneas’ sons and of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the glories of Pallanteum. Next he points out a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grove, which fiery Romulus made the Asylum of a later</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">day, and embowered by the chill dank rock, the Lupercal, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bearing after Arcadian wont the name of Lycæan Pan.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He shows, moreover, the forest of hallowed Argiletum,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and appeals to the spot, and recounts the death of Argus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once his guest. Thence he leads the way to the Tarpeian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temple, even the Capitol, now gay with gold, then rough <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with untrimmed brushwood. Even in that day the sacred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">terrors of the spot awed the trembling rustics; even then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they shuddered at the forest and the rock. “This wood,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he says, “this hill with the shaggy brow, is the home of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a god of whom we know not; my Arcadians believe that <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they have seen there great Jove himself, oft and oft,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shaking with his right hand the shadowy Ægis<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and calling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up the storm. Here, too, in these two towns, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their ramparts overthrown, you see the relics and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chronicles of bygone ages. This tower was built by father <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Janus, that by Saturn; the one’s name Janiculum, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">other’s Saturnia.” So talking together they came nigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the palace where Evander dwells in poverty, and saw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cattle all about lowing in the Roman forum and Carinæ’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">luxurious precinct. When they reached the gate, “This <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">door,” said the host, “Alcides in his triumph stooped to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enter; this mansion contained his presence. Nerve yourself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my guest, to look down on riches, and make your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own soul, like his, such as a god would not disdain, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">take in no churlish sort the welcome of poverty.” He <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">said, and beneath the slope of his narrow roof ushered in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the great Æneas, and laid him to rest on a couch of leaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the skin of a Libyan bear.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Down comes the night, and flaps her sable wings over</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the earth. But Venus, distracted, and not idly, with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mother’s cares, disturbed by the menaces of the Laurentines</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the violence of the gathering storm, addresses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vulcan, and in the nuptial privacy of their golden chamber <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">begins her speech, breathing in every tone the love</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that gods feel: “In old days of war, while the Argive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kings were desolating Pergamus, their destined prey, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ravaging the towers which were doomed to hostile fire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no help for the sufferers, no arms of thy resourceful workmanship <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">did I ask; no, my dearest lord, I chose not to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">task thee and thy efforts to no end, large as was my debt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the sons of Priam, and many the tears that I shed for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas’ cruel agony. Now, by Jove’s commands, he has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set his foot on Rutulian soil; so, with the past in my <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mind, I appear as a suppliant, to ask of his power whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I honour most, as a mother may, armour for my son.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thee the daughter of Nereus, thee the spouse of Tithonus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">found accessible to tears. See but what nations are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mustering, what cities are closing the gate and pointing <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the steel against me and the lives I love.” The speech</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was ended, and the goddess is fondling her undecided</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lord on all sides in the soft embrace of her snowy arms.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Suddenly he caught the wonted fire, the well-known heat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shot to his vitals and threaded his melting frame, even as <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on a day when the fiery rent burst by the thunderclaps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">runs with gleaming flash along the veil of cloud. His</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spouse saw the triumph of her art and felt what beauty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">can do. Then spoke the stern old god, subdued by everlasting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">love: “Why fetch your excuses from so far? <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whither, my queen, has fled your old affiance in me? had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you then been as anxious, even in those old days it had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">been allowed to give arms to the Trojans; nor was the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">almighty sire nor the destinies unwilling that Troy should</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stand and Priam remain in life for ten years more. And <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now, if war is your object and so your purpose holds, all</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">fire can burn and wind blow—cease to show by entreaty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that you mistrust your power.” This said, he gave the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">embrace she longed for, and falling on the bosom of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spouse wooed the calm of slumber in every limb.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, soon as rest, first indulged, had driven sleep <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">away, when flying night had run half her course; just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when a woman, compelled to support life by spinning,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">even by Pallas’ slender craft, wakes to light the fire that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slumbered in the embers, adding night to her day’s work,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and keeps her handmaids labouring long by the blaze, all <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that she may preserve her husband’s bed unsullied, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bring up his infant sons; even so the lord of fire, at an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hour not less slothful, rises from his couch of down to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the toils of the artisan. There rises an island hard by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Sicanian coast and Æolian Lipari, towering with fiery <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mountains; beneath it thunders a cavern, the den of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ætna, blasted out by Cyclop forges; the sound of mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blows echoes on anvils: the smeltings of the Chalybes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hiss through its depths, and the fire pants from the jaws</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the furnace; it is the abode of Vulcan, and the land <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bears Vulcan’s name. Hither, then, the lord of fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">descends from heaven’s height. There, in the enormous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">den, the Cyclops were forging the iron, Brontes, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Steropes, and Pyracmon, the naked giant. In their hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was the rough cast of the thunder-bolt, one of those many <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which the great Father showers down on earth from all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quarters of heaven—part was polished for use, part still</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">incomplete. Three spokes of frozen rain, three of watery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cloud had they put together, three of ruddy flame and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">winged southern wind; and now they were blending with <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what they had done the fearful flash, and the noise, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the terror, and the fury of untiring fire. In another part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they were hurrying on for Mars the car and the flying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wheels, with which he rouses warriors to madness, aye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and whole cities; and with emulous zeal were making <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bright with golden serpent scales the terrible Ægis, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armour of angry Pallas, snakes wreathed together, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">full on the breast of the goddess the Gorgon herself, her</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">neck severed and her eyes rolling. “Away with all this,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cries the god; “take your unfinished tasks elsewhere, you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cyclops of Ætna, and give your attention here. Arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are wanted for a fiery warrior. Now is the call for power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now for swiftness of hand, now for all that art can teach. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn delay into despatch.” No more he said; but they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with speed put their shoulder to the work, sharing it in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">equal parts. Copper flows in streams and golden ore, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steel, that knows how to wound, is molten in the huge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">furnace. They set up in outline a mighty shield, itself <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">singly matched against all the Latian weapons, and tangle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">together seven plates, circle and circle. Some with their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gasping bellows are taking in and giving out the wind;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">others are dipping the hissing copper in the lake. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cave groans under the anvil’s weight. They, one with <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">another, with all a giant’s strength, are lifting their arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in measured cadence, and turning with their griping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tongs the ore on this side and on that.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">his family’s! Nay, he would even link together the dead</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the living, coupling hand with hand and face with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">face—so inventive is the lust of torture—and in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slime and poison of that sickening embrace would destroy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them thus by a lingering dissolution. At last, wearied <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by oppression, his subjects in arms besiege the frantic</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">monster himself and his palace, slay his retainers, shower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">firebrands on his roof. He, mid the carnage, escapes to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulian territory, and shelters himself under Turnus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">friendly power. So all Etruria has risen in righteous <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrath; at once, at the sword’s point, they demand that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the king be surrendered to their vengeance. Of these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thousands, Æneas, I will make you general. For along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the seaboard’s length their ships are swarming and panting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the fray, and calling on the trumpet to sound, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while an aged soothsayer is holding them back by his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fateful utterance: ‘Chosen warriors of Mæonian land, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">power and soul of an ancient nation, whom just resentment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">launches against the foe and Mezentius inflames with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">righteous fury, no Italian may take the reins of a race so <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">proud: choose foreigners to lead you.’ At this the Etruscan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">army settled down on yonder plain, awed by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavenly warning. Tarchon<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> himself has sent me ambassadors</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the royal crown and sceptre, and given to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my hands the ensigns of power, bidding me join the camp,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and assume the Tyrrhene throne. But age, with its enfeebling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chill and the exhaustion of its long term of years,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grudges me the honour of command; my day of martial <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prowess is past. Fain would I encourage my son to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">task, but that the blood of a Sabine mother blending with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mine makes his race half Italian. You, in years and in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">race alike the object of Fate’s indulgence—you, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chosen one of Heaven—assume the place that waits <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you, gallant general of Teucrians and Italians both. Nay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I will give you, too, Pallas here, the hope and solace of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my age; under your tutelage let him learn to endure</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">military service and the war-god’s strenuous labours; let</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your actions be his pattern, and his young admiration be <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">centred on you. To him I will give two hundred Arcadian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horsemen, the flower of my chivalry, and Pallas in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own name shall give you as many more.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce had his words been uttered—and the twain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were holding their eyes in downcast thought, Æneas <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anchises’ son and true Achates, brooding each with his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own sad heart on many a peril, had not Cythera’s goddess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sent a sign from the clear sky. For unforeseen, flashed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the heaven, comes a glare and a peal, and all around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seemed crashing down at once, and the clang of the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrrhene trumpet appeared to blare through ether. They</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">look up: a second and a third time cracks the enormous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sound. Armour enveloped in a cloud in a clear quarter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the firmament is seen to flash redly in the sunlight and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to ring as clashed together. The rest were all amazement; <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but the Trojan hero recognized the sound, and in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it the promise of his goddess mother. Then he cries:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nay, my host, nay, ask not in sooth what chance these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wonders portend; it is I that have a call from on high.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This was the sign that the goddess who gave me birth <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foreshowed me that she would send, should the attack of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war come, while she would bring through the air armour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from Vulcan for my help. Alas! how vast the carnage</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">ready to burst on Laurentum’s wretched sons! what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vengeance, Turnus, shall be mine from thee! how many</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a warrior’s shield and helm and stalwart frame shalt thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">toss beneath thy waters, father Tiber! Aye, clamour for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle, and break your plighted word!” <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus having said, he rises from his lofty seat, and first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of all quickens the altars where the Herculean fires were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">smouldering, and with glad heart approaches the hearth-god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of yesterday, and the small household powers; duly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they sacrifice chosen sheep, Evander for his part and the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trojan youth for theirs. Next he moves on to the ships</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and revisits his crew: from whose number he chooses men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to follow him to the war, eminent in valour: the rest are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wafted down the stream and float lazily along with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">current at their back, to bring Ascanius news of his father <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his fortunes. Horses are given to the Teucrians who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are seeking the Tyrrhene territory, and one is led along,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reserved for Æneas; a tawny lion’s hide covers it wholly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gleaming forth with talons of gold.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At once flies rumour, blazed through the little city, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that the horsemen are marching with speed to the gates</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the Tyrrhene king. In alarm the matrons redouble</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their vows; fear treads on the heels of danger, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">features of the war-god loom larger on the view. Then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Evander, clasping the hand of his departing son, hangs <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">about him with tears that never have their fill, and speaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like this: “Ah! would but Jupiter bring back my bygone</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">years, and make me what I was when under Præneste’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">very walls I struck down the first rank and set a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conqueror’s torch to piles of shields, and with this my <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand sent down to Tartarus king Erulus, whom at his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">birth his mother Feronia endowed with three lives—fearful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to tell—and a frame that could thrice bear arms:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrice had he to be struck down in death: yet from him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on that day this hand took all those three lives, and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrice stripped that armour—never should I, as now, be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">torn, my son, from your loved embrace. Never would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mezentius have laid dishonour on a neighbour’s crest,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">dealt with his sword that repeated havoc, and bereaved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my city of so many of her sons. But you, great powers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">above, and thou, Jupiter, mightiest ruler of the gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have pity, I implore you, on an Arcadian monarch, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give ear to a father’s prayer; if your august will, if destiny <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has in store for me the safe return of my Pallas, if life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will make me see him and meet him once more, then I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pray that I may live; there is no trial I cannot bear to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">outlast. But if thou, dark Fortune, threatenest any unnamed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">calamity, now, oh, now, be it granted me to snap <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">life’s ruthless thread, while care wears a double face,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while hope cannot spell the future, while you, darling boy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my love and late delight, are still in my arms: nor let</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my ears be pierced by tidings more terrible.” So was the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father heard to speak at their last parting; his servants <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were seen carrying within doors their fallen lord.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now the cavalry had passed the city’s open gates,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas among the first and true Achates, and after them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the other Trojan nobles; Pallas himself the centre of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">column, conspicuous with gay scarf and figured armour; <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">even as the morning-star just bathed in the waves of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ocean, Venus’ favourite above all the stellar fires, sets in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a moment on the sky his heavenly countenance, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">melts the darkness. There are the trembling matrons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">standing on the walls, following with their eyes the cloud <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of dust and the gleam of the brass-clad companies. They</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in their armour are moving through the underwood, their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eye on the nearest path: hark! a shout mounts up, a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">column is formed, and the four-foot beat of the hoof shakes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the crumbling plain. Near the cool stream of Cære stands <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a vast grove, clothed by hereditary reverence with wide-spread</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sanctity; on all sides it is shut in by the hollows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of hills, which encompass its dark pine-wood shades.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rumour says that the old Pelasgians dedicated it to Silvanus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">god of the country and the cattle, a grove with a <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">holiday—the people who once in early times dwelt on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Latian frontier. Not far from this Tarchon and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrrhenians were encamped in a sheltered place, and from</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">the height of the hill their whole army spread already to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the view, as they pitched at large over the plain. Hither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">come father Æneas and the chosen company of warriors,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and refresh the weariness of themselves and their steeds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Venus had come in her divine beauty through the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dark clouds of heaven with the gifts in her hand, and soon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as she saw her son far retired in the vale in the privacy of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the cool stream, she thus accosted him, appearing suddenly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">before him: “See, here is the present completed by my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lord’s promised skill: now you will not need to hesitate <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to-morrow about daring to the combat the haughty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laurentians or fiery Turnus’ self.” So said the lady of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cythera, and sought her son’s embrace: the arms she set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up to glitter under an oak that faced his view. He,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">exulting in the goddess’ gifts, and charmed with their <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dazzling beauty, cannot feast his eyes enough as he rolls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them from point to point, admiring and turning over in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his hands and arms the helmet with its dread crest, vomiting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flame, the fateful sword, the stiff brazen corslet, blood-red</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and huge, in hue as when a dark cloud kindles with <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sunlight and gleams afar; the polished cuishes,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> too, of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">electrum and gold smelted oft and oft, and the spear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the shield’s ineffable frame-work. On this was the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">story of Italy and the triumphs of the Romans wrought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the Lord of the fire; no stranger he to prophecy nor <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ignorant of the time to come: on it was the whole royal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">line of the future from Ascanius onward, and their foughten</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fields in long succession. There, too, he had portrayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the mother-wolf stretched in Mars’ green cavern; around</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her teats were the twin boys in play climbing and clinging, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and licking their dam without dread; while she, her lithe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">neck bent back, was caressing them by turns and with her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tongue shaping their young limbs. Near this he had inserted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rome and the lawless rape of the Sabine maidens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">amid the crowded circus, while the great games were in <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course, and the sudden rise of a new war between the sons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Romulus and ancient Tatius with his austere Cures.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Afterwards were seen the two kings, the conflict set at rest,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">standing in arms before the altar of Jove with goblets in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their hands and cementing a treaty with swine’s blood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not far off Mettus had already been torn asunder by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chariots driven apart—ah! false Alban, were you but a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keeper of your word!—and Tullus was dragging the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">traitor’s flesh through the woodland, while the bushes were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sprinkled with the bloody rain. There, too, was Porsenna</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">insisting that exiled Tarquin should be taken back and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaguering the city with a mighty siege: Æneas’ sons were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flinging themselves on the sword in freedom’s cause. In <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his face might be seen the likeness of wrath, and the likeness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of menace, that Cocles<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> should have the courage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to tear down the bridge, that Cloelia should break her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prison and swim the river. There was Manlius standing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sentinel on the summit of the Tarpeian fortress in the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temple’s front, holding the height of the Capitol, while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Romulean thatch looked fresh and sharp on the palace-roof.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And there was the silver goose fluttering its wings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the gilded cloister, and shrieking that the Gauls were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the door. The Gauls were at hand marching among <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the brushwood, and had gained the summit sheltered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the darkness and the kindly grace of dusky night.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Golden is their hair and golden their raiment; striped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cloaks gleam on their shoulders; their milk-white necks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are twined with gold; each brandishes two Alpine javelins, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his body guarded by the long oval of his shield. There</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he had shown in relief the Salii in their dances and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">naked Luperci, and the woolly peaks of their caps, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sacred shields which fell from heaven: chaste matrons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were making solemn progress through the city in their <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soft-cushioned cars. At distance from these he introduces</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">too the mansions of Tartarus, Pluto’s yawning portals,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the torments of crime, and thee, Catiline, poised on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the beetling rock and quailing at grim Fury-faces: and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the good in their privacy, with Cato as their lawgiver. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Stretching in its breadth among these swept the semblance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the swelling sea, all of gold, but the blue was made to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foam with whitening billows; and all about it dolphins</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">of bright silver in joyous circles were lashing the surface</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with their tails and cutting the tide. In the midst might</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be seen fleets of brazen ships, the naval war of Actium;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you might remark the whole of Leucate aglow with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war-god’s array, and the waves one blaze of gold. On this <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side is Augustus Cæsar leading the Italians to conflict,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the senate and the people, the home-gods and their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty brethren, standing aloft on the stern: his auspicious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brows emit twin-born flames, and his ancestral</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">star dawns over his head. Elsewhere is Agrippa with the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">winds and the gods at his back, towering high as he leads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his column; his brows gleam with the beaked circle of a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">naval crown, the glorious ornament of war. On that side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is Antonius with his barbaric powers and the arms of divers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lands, triumphant from the nations of the dawn-goddess <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the red ocean’s coast, carrying with him Egypt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the strength of the East and the utmost parts of Bactria,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and at his side—shame on the profanation!—his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Egyptian spouse.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> All are seen at once in fierce onward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">motion: the whole sea-floor foams up, torn by the backward <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pull of the oars and by the three-fanged beaks.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On to the deep! you would deem that uprooted Cyclades</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were swimming the sea, or that tall hills were meeting hills</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in battle; such the giant effort, with which the warriors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">urge on their tower-crowned ships. From the hand is <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scattered a shower of flaming tow and flying steel: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plains of Neptune redden with unwonted carnage. In the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">midst of them the queen is cheering on her forces with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the timbrel of her native land; casting as yet no glance on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the twin-born snakes that threaten her rear. There are <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the portentous gods of all the nations, and Anubis<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">barking monster, brandishing their weapons in the face</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Neptune and Venus and in the face of Pallas. Midmost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the fray storms Mavors,<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> relieved in iron, and fell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fury-fiends swooping from the sky; and Discord sweeps <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">along in the glory of her rent mantle, and at her back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Bellona with blood-dropping scourge. There was Actium’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo, with his eye on the fray, bending his bow from</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">above; at whose terror all Egypt and Ind, all Arabia, all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sons of Saba<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> were turning the back in flight. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queen herself was shown spreading her sails to friendly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breezes, and just loosing the sheets. On her face the Lord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the Fire had written the paleness of foreshadowed <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">death, as she drove on among corpses before the tide and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the zephyr; over against her was Nile, his vast body writhing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in woe, throwing open his bosom, and with his whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flowing raiment inviting the vanquished to his green lap</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his sheltering flood. But Cæsar, entering the walls <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Rome in threefold triumph, was consecrating to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gods of Italy a votive tribute of deathless gratitude, three</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hundred mighty fanes the whole city through. The ways</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were ringing with gladness and with games and with plausive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">peal; in every temple thronged a matron company, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in every temple an altar blazed; in front of the altars</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slaughtered bullocks strewed the floor. The hero himself,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">throned on dazzling Phœbus’ snow-white threshold, is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">telling over the offerings of all the nations and hanging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them up on the proud temple gates; there in long procession <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">move the conquered peoples, diverse in tongue, diverse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no less in garb and in armour. Here had Mulciber portrayed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Nomad race and the zoneless sons of Afric:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here, too, Leleges and Carians and quivered Gelonians:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Euphrates was flowing with waves subdued already; and <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Morini, furthest of mankind, and Rhine with his crescent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horn, and tameless Dahæ, and Araxes chafing to be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bridged. Such sights Æneas scans with wonder on Vulcan’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shield, his mother’s gift, and joys in the portraiture</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of things he knows not, as he heaves on his shoulder the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fame and the fate of grandsons yet to be.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While these things are in progress far away, Juno,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saturn’s daughter, has sent down Iris from above on an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">errand to Turnus the bold. It chanced that then Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was sitting in the grove of his sire Pilumnus, deep in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hallowed dell. Him then the child<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> of Thaumas bespoke <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus from her rosy lips: “Turnus, what no god would have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dared to promise to your prayers, lo! the mere lapse of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">time has brought to you unasked. Æneas, leaving behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town, comrades, and fleet, is gone to seek the realm of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Palatine, the settlement of Evander. Nor is that all: <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he has won his way to Corythus’ farthest towns, and is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arming the Lydian bands, the crowds of country folk. Why</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hesitate? now, now is the moment to call for horse and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">car; fling delay to the winds, and come down on the bewildered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">camp.” So saying, she raised herself aloft on the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">poise of her wings, and drew as she fled along the clouds her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty bow. The warrior knew his visitant, lifted his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">two hands to heaven, and pursued her flight with words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like these: “Iris, fair glory of the sky, who has sent thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down from heaven to earth on an errand to me? I see <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the firmament parting asunder, and the stars reeling about</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the poles. Yes! I follow thy mighty presage, whoe’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thou art thus calling me to arms.” With these words he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">went to the river-side, and took up water from the brimming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flood, calling oft on the gods and burdening heaven <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a multitude of vows.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now his whole army was in motion along the open</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plain, richly dowered with horses, richly dowered with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gold and broidered raiment. Messapus<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> marshals the van,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrrheus’ warrior-sons the rear: Turnus himself, the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">general, is in the centre—like Ganges with his seven calm</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">streams proudly rising through the silence, or Nile when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he withdraws from the plain his fertilizing waters and has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at last subsided into his bed. Suddenly the Teucrians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">look forth on a cloud massed with murky dust, and see</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">darkness gathering over the plain. First cries Caicus from <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rampart’s front: “What mass have we here, my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">countrymen, rolling towards us, black as night? Quick</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the steel, bring weapons, man the walls, the enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is upon us, ho!” With loud shouts the Teucrians pour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">themselves through all the gates and through the bulwarks. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For such had been the charge of Æneas, that best of soldiers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when going on his way; should aught fall out meantime,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">let them not venture to draw out their lines or try</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fortune of the field: enough for them to guard camp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and wall safe behind their earthworks. So now, though <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shame and anger prompt to an engagement, they shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">themselves nevertheless with closed gates in pursuance of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his bidding, and armed, within the covert of their towers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">await the foe. Turnus, just as he had galloped on in advance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of his tardy column, appears unforeseen before the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gate with a chosen following of twenty horse: with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thracian steed to carry him, spotted with white, and a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">golden helm with scarlet crest to guard his head. “Now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gallants, which of you will venture with me first against</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the foe? Look there!” he cries, and with a whirl sends <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his javelin into the air, the overture of battle, and proudly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prances over the plain. His friends second him with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shout and follow with dreadful cries; they wonder at the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teucrians’ sluggish hearts—men-at-arms, not to trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">themselves to a fair field or fight face to face, but keep <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nursing their camp. Enraged, he rides round and round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the walls, and looks out for an opening where way is none.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even as a wolf, lying in wait to surprise a crowded fold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whines about the enclosure, exposed to wind and rain, at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mid of night; the lambs, nestling safe under their mothers, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keep bleating loudly; he, maddened and reckless, gnashes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his teeth at the prey beyond his reach, tormented by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long-gathered rage of hunger and his dry bloodless jaws:</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">just so the Rutulian scans wall and camp with kindling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrath; grief fires the marrow of his iron bones—how to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">essay an entrance? what way to dash the prisoned Trojans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the rampart and fling them forth on level</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ground? Close to the camp’s side was lying the fleet, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shored round by earthworks and by the river; this he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">assails, calling for fire to his exulting mates, and filling his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand with a blazing pine, himself all aglow. Driven on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by Turnus’ presence, they double their efforts: each soldier</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the band equips himself with his murky torch. See, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they have stripped the hearths: the smoking brand sends</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up a pitchy glare, and the Fire-god wafts clouds of soot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and flame heaven-high.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">What god, ye Muses, shielded the Teucrians from a fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so terrible? who warded off from the ships so vast a conflagration? <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tell me; the faith in the tale is old, but its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fame is evergreen.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">In early days, when Æneas in Phrygian Ida was first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fashioning his fleet and making ready for the high seas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the great mother of the gods, they say, the Berecyntian <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queen, thus addressed almighty Jove: “Grant, my son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to thy mother’s prayer the boon she asks thee on thy conquest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Olympus. A pine-forest is mine, endeared by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">love of many years, a sacred grove on the mountain’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">height, whither worshippers brought their offerings, bedarkened <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with black pitch-trees and trunks of maple:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these I was fain to give to the youth of Dardany when he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">needed a fleet; now my anxious heart is wrung by disturbing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fears. Release me from my dread, and let a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mother’s prayer avail thus much: let them be overcome <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by no strain of voyage, no violence of wind; give them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">good of their birth on my sacred hill.” To her replied her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">son, who wields the starry sphere: “O mother, whither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wouldst thou wrest the course of fate? what askest thou</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for these thy favourites? should vessels framed by mortal <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand have charter of immortality? should Æneas, himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">assured, meet perils all unsure? What god had ever</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">privilege so great? Nay, rather, when their service is</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">over and they gain one day the haven of Ausonia, from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all such as escape the waves and convoy the Dardan chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">safe to Laurentian soil, I will take away their perishable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shape, and summon them to the state of goddesses of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty ocean, in form like Nereus’ children, Doto and <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Galatea, when they breast the foaming deep.” He said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and by the river of his Stygian brother, by the banks that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seethe with pitch and are washed by the murky torrent, he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nodded confirmation, and with his nod made all Olympus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tremble. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So now the promised day was come, and the Destinies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had fulfilled the time appointed, when Turnus’ lawless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">violence gave warning to the mighty mother to ward off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the firebrand from her consecrated ships. Now in a moment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a strange light flashed on the eyes of all, and a great <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cloud was seen from the quarter of the dawn-goddess</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">running athwart the sky, with the choirs of Ida in its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">train; then came darting through the air a voice of terror,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thrilling the ranks of Trojan and Rutulian from end to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">end: “Busy not yourselves, ye Teucrians, to defend my <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ships, nor take weapons into your hands: Turnus shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have leave to burn up the ocean sooner than to consume</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my sacred pines. Go free, my favourites: go and be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goddesses of the sea: it is the mother’s voice that bids</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you.” And at once each ship snaps her cable from the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bank, and like a dolphin dips her beak and makes for the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bottom. Then all emerge in maiden forms, a marvel to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">behold, and breast the main, as many as stood a moment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ago with their brazen prows to the shore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amazement seized the Rutulians; terror came on Messapus <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself, confusion on his steeds; even Tiber, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">river, pauses, murmuring hoarsely, and retraces his seaward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">course. But bold Turnus’ confidence felt no check;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no, his words are ready to encourage and upbraid: “It</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is at the Trojans that these portents point: Jove himself <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has robbed them of their wonted resource; they wait not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for Rutulian fire and sword to do the work. Yes, the sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is impassable to the Teucrians; hope of flight have they</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">none; one half of nature is taken from them; as for earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it is in our hands, thanks to the thousands here standing in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms, the tribes of Italy. I care not for the fateful utterances</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of heaven that these Phrygians vaunt, be they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what they may: fate and Venus have had license enough, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in that the Trojans have set foot on the soil of our rich</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonia. I, too, have a fate of my own, to mow down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the sword the guilty nation that has stolen my bride;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that wrong of theirs comes not home to the Atridæ alone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor has Mycenæ alone the privilege of going to war. But <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one destruction is enough for them—aye, had one transgression</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">been enough, so that they had henceforth loathed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sex well-nigh to a woman. Men who trust in their intervening</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rampart, whom the pause at the trench, those few</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">feet of distance from death, inspires with courage. Why, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">did they not see their city of Troy sink into the fire, though</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">built by the hand of Neptune? But you, my chosen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mates, who is there ready to hew down the rampart and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rush with me on their bewildered camp? I need not the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms of Vulcan nor a thousand sail for <i>my</i> Trojan war. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let all Etruria join them in a body. Night alarms, cowardly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thefts of their guardian image, slaughterings of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sentry on the height, they need fear none of these; we will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not skulk in a horse’s murky womb: in broad day, in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sight of all, I stand pledged to put a ring of fire round their <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">walls. I will not let them fancy they are dealing with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Danaans and the Pelasgian chivalry, whom Hector</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kept ten years waiting for their due. Now, since the better</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">part of the day is spent, for what remains, gallants, refresh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yourselves after your good service, and be assured that <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle is getting ready.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime the charge is given to Messapus to leaguer the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gates with relays of watchmen, and throw a girdle of fire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round the ramparts. Twice seven Rutulian chiefs are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chosen to keep armed observation of the walls: a hundred <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warriors attend on each, red with scarlet crests and gleaming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with gold. They move from place to place and relieve</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one another, and stretched on the grass give wine its fling</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and tilt the brazen bowl. Bright shine the fires: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warders speed the wakeful night with sport and game.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The Trojans look forth on the scene from their earthworks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as in arms they man the summit; with anxious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fear they test the gates, and link bridge and bulwark, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their weapons in their hands. First in the work are Mnestheus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and keen Serestus, whom father Æneas, should</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">adverse crisis call for action, left to command the warriors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and govern affairs at home. The whole army along the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wall, dividing the danger, keeps guard, each relieving <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each at the post assigned.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The warder of the gate was Nisus, a soldier of keenest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mettle, Hyrtacus’ son, whom Ida the huntress sent to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">attend Æneas, quick with the dart and the flying arrow:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and at his side Euryalus, than who was none fairer among <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas’ children, none that ever donned the arms of Troy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a stripling whose unrazored cheeks just showed the first</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bloom of youth. Theirs was a common love: side by side</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they wont<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> to rush into the battle: and even then they were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keeping watch at the gate in joint duty. Nisus exclaims: <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Is it the gods, Euryalus, that make men’s hearts glow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus? or does each one’s ungoverned yearning become his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">god? My heart has long been astir to rush on war or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">other mighty deed, nor will peaceful quiet content it.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You see the Rutulians there, delivered up to confidence <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the future: their line of lights gleams brokenly: unnerved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with sleep and wine, yonder they lie: all around is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">still. Listen on, and learn on what I am brooding, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what thought is this moment uppermost. ‘Æneas should</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be recalled’—so cry people and leaders as one man; <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">‘messengers should be sent to tell him the truth.’ If they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pledge themselves to what I ask for you—for me the fame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the deed is sufficient—methinks under the mound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yonder I could find a way to the city walls of Pallanteum.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A thrill of generous ambition struck wonder into Euryalus, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as thus he addressed his glowing friend: “And would you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shrink from taking me with you, Nisus, on this high occasion?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Am I to send you out alone on such perilous</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">errand? It was not thus that my father, the veteran</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Opheltes, reared and bred me among Argive terrors and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trojan agonies, nor have such been my doings at your side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">since I followed our hero Æneas and his desperate fate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here, here, within me is a soul that thinks scorn of happy <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sunshine, and deems that the glory at which you aim were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cheaply bought with life.” “Nay,” returns Nisus, “trust</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me, I had no such fear of you—none such had been just:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so may I return to you in triumph, by grace of mighty Jove,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or whosoever now looks down on us with righteous eyes. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But should aught—and a venture like this, you see, has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a thousand such—should aught sway things amiss, be it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chance or heaven’s will, I would fain have you spared:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yours is the meeter age for life. Let me have one to rescue</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me in fight, or redeem me by ransom paid, and so consign <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me to the burial all receive: or should Fortune grudge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">even that, to pay me the rites of the absent, and give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me the adornment of a tomb. Nor let me be the cause of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grief so terrible to that unhappy parent, who alone of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">many matrons has had a heart to follow you, dear boy, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor cares for the city of great Acestes.” He replied:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Spinning empty pretexts is idle work: there is no change</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or faltering in my resolve. Up and despatch!” At once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he rouses the guard, who take his place and fulfil their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">time, while he, departing from the post, walks side by side <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with Nisus, and they seek the prince together.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">All else that breathed on earth were asleep, their load of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">care unbound, their hearts oblivious of toil; the chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaders of the Teucrians, the flower of the host, were holding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">council on the crisis in their realm’s fortune, what they <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should do, or who should at length be sent with the news</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Æneas. There they stand propped on their long spears,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their shields still in their hands, in the midst of camp and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plain. At this moment Nisus and Euryalus eagerly crave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">instant admission—the affair is great, say they, and well <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">worth the pause it claims. Iulus was the first to welcome</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and reassure them, and bid Nisus speak. Then began the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">son of Hyrtacus: “Listen, ye sons of Troy, with kindly</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">heed, nor let these our proffers be judged by our years.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The Rutulians, unnerved by sleep and wine, are hushed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in silence: we have ourselves observed a place for a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stealthy move, open through the passage of the gate which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">abuts on the sea. The line of fires is broken, and only <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dusky smoke rises to the sky: give us but leave to make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">use of fortune, and go in quest of Æneas and the walls of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallanteum, soon shall you see us here again after a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage, laden with spoils. Nor can the way mislead us</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as we go: we have seen in the dimness of the vale the outskirts <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the city while persevering in our hunting, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have made acquaintance with the whole river’s course.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then spoke Aletes, weighty with years and ripe of understanding:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gods of our fathers, whose constant presence</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">watches over Troy, not yet in spite of all do ye purpose to <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">make an utter end of us Teucrians, when such are the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spirits and so steadfast the hearts ye breed in our youth.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As he said this, he kept embracing the necks and hands of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">both, and bathing his cheeks in floods of tears. “What</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">guerdons, gallant men, what can I fancy of worth enough <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to pay you for glories like these? First and richest of all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will be the praise of heaven and your own hearts: next</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to these you will receive the rest without fail from good</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas and young Ascanius, who will never forget a service</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so great.” “Nay,” cries Ascanius, “let me speak, me, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whose safety is bound up with my sire’s return: by our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">great household gods I adjure you, Nisus, by the deity of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Assaracus’ house and the shrine of reverend Vesta—all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my fortune, all my trust, I place in your hands: bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back my father, let me see him again; he once restored, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all grief is over. I will give you a pair of goblets wrought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with silver and rough from the chasing-tool, which my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father took when he conquered Arisba, a couple of tripods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">two great talents of gold, and an ancient bowl, Sidonian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dido its donor. But if it be our victorious fortune to <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conquer Italy and attain the crown, and appoint the lot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the booty—you saw the horse which Turnus rode, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms in which he moved all golden—that horse, that</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">shield, and the scarlet crest I will set apart from the lot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and count it, Nisus, yours already. Moreover, my sire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall give you twelve matron captives of choicest beauty,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">male prisoners too, each with his armour, and, to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crown all, the portion of domain held by king Latinus <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself. But you, whose years are followed at nearer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">distance by my own, revered youth, I take at once to my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heart, and fold you there, my comrade for whatever betides.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Never will I seek glory for my own estate apart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from you: whether I have peace or war on hand, yours <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall be my utmost confidence in deed and in word.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To him spoke Euryalus in reply: “No length of time shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">find me false to the promise of my bold essay: let but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fortune speed and not thwart us. But one boon I would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ask of you beyond all others: I have a mother of Priam’s <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancient house, whom not the land of Ilium, not the city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of king Acestes, could keep, poor soul, from going with me.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Her I am now leaving, ignorant of this peril, be it what it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may, with no word of greeting—Night and your right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand are my witnesses—because I could not bear a parent’s <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tears. But you, I pray, comfort her need and support</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her lonely age. With this trust in you to bear along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with me, I shall meet all that happens with a bolder</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spirit.” Touched to the heart, the children of Dardanus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broke into tears—chief of all the fair Iulus, as the picture <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of his own filial love flashed upon his soul. Thus he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">speaks: “Assure yourself that all shall be done that your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty deeds deserve. Yes, she shall be my own mother,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nought wanting but the name to make her Creusa’s self;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to have borne you lays up no mean store of gratitude. <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whatever the fortune that attends your endeavour, I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swear by this my head, by which my father has been wont</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to swear, all that I promise to you in the event of your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prosperous return, shall remain in its fulness assured to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your mother and your house.” This he says weeping, and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unbelts from his shoulder a gilded sword wrought with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rare art by Lycaon of Crete, and fitted for use with a scabbard</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ivory. To Nisus Mnestheus gives a skin, a lion’s</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">shaggy spoils: Aletes, true of heart, makes an exchange</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of helmets. Their arming done they march along; and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as they go, the whole band of nobles, young and old, escorts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them to the gate with prayers for their safety. There too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was fair Iulus, in heart and forethought manlier than his <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">years, giving them many a charge to carry to his father.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the winds scatter all alike, and deliver them cancelled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the clouds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Passing through the gate, they cross the trenches, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the midnight shade make for the hostile camp—destined, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">though, first to be the death of many. All about</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the grass they see bodies stretched at length by sleep and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wine, cars tilted up on the shore, men lying among wheels</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and harness, with armour and pools of wine about them.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">First spoke the son of Hyrtacus: “Euryalus, daring hands <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are wanted; the occasion now calls for action; here lies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our way. Do you keep watch and wide look-out, lest any</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand be lifted against us from behind; I will lay these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranks waste, and give you a broad path to walk in.” So</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">saying, he checks his voice, and at once with his tyrannous <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword assails Rhamnes, who, pillowed on a vast pile of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rugs, was breathing from all his breast the breath of sleep—a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king himself, and king Turnus’ favourite augur;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but his augury availed him not to ward off death. Close</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by he surprises three attendants, stretched carelessly <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among their weapons, and Remus’ armour-bearer and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">charioteer, catching him as he lay at the horses’ side:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the steel shears through their drooping necks; then he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lops the head of their lord, and leaves the trunk gurgling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and spouting blood, while ground and couch are reeking <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with black streams of gore. Lamyrus too, and Lamus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and young Serranus, who had played long that night in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pride of his beauty, and was lying with the dream-god’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand heavy upon him; happy, had he made his play as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">long as the night, and pushed it into morning. Like a <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hungry lion making havoc through a teeming fold—for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the madness of famine constrains him—he goes mangling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and dragging along the feeble cattle, dumb with terror,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and gnashing his bloody teeth. Nor less the carnage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Euryalus: he, too, all on fire, storms along, and slays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on his road a vast and nameless crowd, Fadus and Herbesus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Rhœtus and Abaris—unconscious these:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rhœtus was awake and saw it all, but in his fear he <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crouched behind a massive bowl; whence, as he rose, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conqueror plunged into his fronting breast the length of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his sword, and drew it back with a torrent of death. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dying man vomits forth his crimson life, and disgorges</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mingled wine and blood: the foe pursues his stealthy work. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now he was making for Messapus’ followers, for there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he saw the flicker of dying fires, and horses tied and browsing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at their ease; when thus spoke Nisus in brief, seeing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him hurried on by passion and excess of slaughter: “Forbear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">we now; the daylight, our enemy, is at hand; we <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have supped on vengeance to the full; a highway is open</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the foe.” Many warriors’ arms they leave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrought of solid silver, many bowls and gorgeous coverlets.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Euryalus lays hand on Rhamnes’ trappings and his belt</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with golden studs, sent by wealthy Cædicus of old as a <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">present to Remulus of Tiber, when he fain would make</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him his friend from a distance; he, dying, leaves them to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his grandson, after whose death the Rutulians won them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in battle; these he strips off, and fits them to his valiant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breast, all for nought. Then he puts on Messapus’ shapely <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">helm, with its graceful crest. They leave the camp, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pass into safety.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile a troop of horse, sent on from the town of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latium, while the rest of the force abides drawn up on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">field, was on its way with a message to king Turnus, three <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hundred, shield-bearers all, with Volscens, their chief.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They were just nearing the camp, and passing under the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wall, when at distance they spy the two bending to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left, and the helmet, seen in the glimmering twilight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">betrayed the heedless Euryalus, as the moonbeam flashed <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">full upon it. The sight fell not on idle eyes. Volscens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shouts from his band: “Halt, gallants; tell your errand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who you are thus armed, and whither you are going.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">They venture no reply, but hasten the faster to the woods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and make the night their friend. The horsemen bar each</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">well-known passage right and left and set a guard on every</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">outlet. The wood was shagged with thickets and dark</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ilex boughs; impenetrable briars filled it on every side; <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the concealed tracks just gleamed a narrow path.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Euryalus is hampered by the darkness of the branches,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the encumbrance of his booty, and fear makes him miss</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the right line of road. Nisus shoots away: and now in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his forgetfulness he had escaped the foe, and gained the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">region afterwards called Alban from Alba’s name; in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that day king Latinus had there his stately stalls; when he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">halted, and looked back in vain for the friend he could not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see. “My poor Euryalus! where have I left you? what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">way shall I trace you, unthreading all the tangled path of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that treacherous wood?” As he speaks, he scans and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">retraces each step, and wanders through the stillness of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the brakes. He hears the horses, hears the noise and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tokens of pursuit. Pass a few moments, and a shout</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strikes on his ear, and he sees Euryalus, who is in the hands <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the whole crew, the victim of the ground and the night,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bewildered by the sudden onslaught, hurried along, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">making a thousand fruitless efforts. What should he do?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with what force, what arms, can he attempt a rescue?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should he dash through the thick of their swords with <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">death before his eyes, and hurry to a glorious end in a shower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of wounds? Soon, with his arm drawn back, he poises his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear-shaft, looking up to the moon in the sky, and thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prays aloud: “Thou, goddess, be thou present, and befriend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my endeavour, Latona’s daughter, glory of the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavens and guardian of the woods: if ever my father</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hyrtacus brought gift for me to thine altar, if ever my own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hunting swelled the tribute, if ever I hung an offering from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy dome or fastened it on thy hallowed summit, suffer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me to confound this mass, and guide my weapons through <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the air.” This said, with an effort of his whole frame he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hurled the steel. The flying spear strikes through the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shades of night, reaches the turned back of Sulmo, there</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">snaps short, and pierces the midriff with the broken</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wood. Down he tumbles, disgorging from his breast the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warm life-torrent that leaves him cold, and long choking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gasps smite on his sides. They look round this way and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that: while the same fell arm, nerved by success, is levelling, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">see! another weapon from the ear-tip. While all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is confusion, the spear has passed through Tagus’ two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temples with whizzing sound, and lies warmly lodged in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cloven brain. Volscens storms with fury, yet sees nowhere</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the author of the wound, nor on whom to vent his <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rage; “You, however, shall pay both debts meanwhile</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with your heart’s blood,” cries he; and speaking, rushes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with drawn sword on Euryalus. Then, indeed, in frantic</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">agony, Nisus shouts aloud; no more care had he to hide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself in darkness, no more strength to bear grief so <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">terrible: “Me, me! behold the doer! make me your mark,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O Rutulians! mine is all the blame; he had no heart, no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand for such deeds; this heaven, these stars know that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it is true; it was but that he loved his unhappy friend too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">well.” Thus he was pleading; but the sword, driven with <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the arm’s full force, has pierced the ribs and is rending the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snowy breast. Down falls Euryalus in death; over his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beauteous limbs gushes the blood, and his powerless neck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sinks on his shoulders; as when a purple flower, severed by</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A tower there was, vast to look on from below, with</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Italians, with utmost force and utmost strain of might,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were essaying to storm, while the Trojans, on their side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were defending it with stones, and hurling showers of <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">darts through its narrow eyelets. Turnus the first flung</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a blazing torch and fastened fire on its side; fanned by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the wind, the flame seized the planks and lodged in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">consuming doors. The inmates are all in confusion, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in vain seek to escape the mischief. While they huddle <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">together and retire upon the part which the plague has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spared, in an instant the tower falls heavily down, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">firmament thunders with the crash. Half dead they come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the ground, the huge fabric following on their backs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pierced by their own weapons, their breasts impaled by the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cruel wood. Barely two escaped, Helenor and Lycus—Helenor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in prime of youth, whom Licymnia the slave had</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as he saw himself with Turnus’ thousands round him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the armies of Latium standing on this side and on that,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">vents her rage on the darts and flings herself deliberately</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">thus the doomed youth rushes on the midst of the foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">making for where he sees the darts are thickest. But</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lycus, far swifter of foot, winds among ranks of foes and <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">showers of steel and gains the wall, and strives to clutch</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fabric’s summit and reach the hands of his friends.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whom Turnus, following him at once with foot and javelin,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">taunts in victorious tone: “Dreamed you, poor fool, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you could escape my hands?” and with that he seizes him <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he hangs in air, and pulls him down with a great fragment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the wall; just as the bearer of Jove’s thunder</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trusses in his hooked talons a hare or a snow-white swan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and soars into the sky, or one of Mars’ wolves snatches</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the fold a lamb which its mother’s bleatings reclaim <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in vain. On all sides rises the war-shout. They rush on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the trenches and fill them with shattered earthworks,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while others fling brazen firebrands to the roofs. Ilioneus</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Cæneus slays Ortygius, Turnus the conqueror Cæneus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus Itys and Clonius, Dioxippus and Promolus, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Sagaris, and Idas, who was standing on the turret’s top. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Capys kills Privernus: Themilla’s flying spear had grazed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him first; he, poor fool, dropped his buckler and clapped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his hand to the wound, so the arrow came on stealthy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wing, and the hand was pinned to the left side, and the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">There stood the son of Arcens in conspicuous armour,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Then first, they say, Ascanius levelled in war his winged</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">by surname, who had lately won and wedded Turnus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">younger sister. He was stalking in front of the host,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vaunting aloud things meet and unmeet to tell, in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">insolence of new-blown royalty, and venting his pride in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clamorous tones: “Are ye not ashamed to be imprisoned <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yet again in leaguer and rampart, twice-captured Phrygians,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and to put your walls between you and death? Lo, these</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">What god, what madness, has driven you to Italy? You</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will not find the Atridæ here, nor Ulysses the forger of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">speech. A hardy race even from the stock, we bring our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sons soon as born to the river’s side, and harden them with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the water’s cruel cold. Our boys spend long days in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chase, and weary out the forest; their sport is to rein the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steed, and level shafts from the bow. Our youth, strong <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to labour and schooled by want, subdues the earth with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rake, or shakes the city’s walls with battle. All our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">life we ply the steel; with the butt of our spears we belabour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our cattle; old age, which dulls all else, impairs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not the force of our hearts or changes our fresh vigour; <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hoary head is clasped by the helmet; our constant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">joy is to bring home new booty and live by rapine. Yours</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">sauntering and sloth are your delight; your pleasure is to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">men, and meddle no more with steel.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Such boasting and such ill-omened talk Ascanius could</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bear no longer; setting his breast to the bow-string of</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">horsehair he levelled his dart, and drawing his arms wide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">apart he stood, having first invoked Jove thus in suppliant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prayer: “Jove Almighty, smile on my bold essay; with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my own hand I will bring to thy temple yearly offerings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and will set before thine altar a bullock with gilded brow, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snowy white, rearing his head to the height of his mother’s,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fit to butt with the horn and spurn up sand with the hoof.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The father heard and from a cloudless quarter of the sky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thundered on the left; at the same instant twanged the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deadly bow. Forth flies the arrow from the string, whizzing <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fearfully, passes through the head of Remulus, and cleaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with its point his hollow temples. “Go, make valour the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sport of your boasting; the twice-captured Phrygians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">answer the Rutulians thus.” So far Ascanius: the Teucrians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">second him with a cry, shout for joy, and mount <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavenward in their exultation. It chanced that then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the realm of sky long-haired Apollo was surveying the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armies of Ausonia and the city, seated on a cloud; and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus addressed Iulus in the moment of triumph: “Rejoice,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brave youth, in your new-won laurels; ’tis thus <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">men climb the stars; son of gods that are, sire of gods that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall be! Well has Fate ordered that beneath the house</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Assaracus the wars of the future shall find their end;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor can Troy contain your prowess.” So saying he shoots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down from heaven, parts before him the breathing gales, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and makes for Ascanius. He changes his features to those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ancient Butes, who had once been armour-bearer to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dardanian Anchises and trusty watcher at the gate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thence Ascanius’ sire made him his son’s guardian. Apollo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moved along, in all things like the aged veteran, the voice, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the colour, the white locks, the fiercely clanking armour;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and thus he spoke to Iulus’ glowing heart: “Suffice it,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">child of Æneas, that Numanus has met from your darts an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unrequited death: this your maiden glory great Apollo</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vouchsafes you freely, nor looks with jealousy on weapons <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like his own; for the rest abstain from war, as stripling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should.” So Apollo began, and ere his speech was well</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">done parted from mortal eyes, and vanished from sight</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">into unsubstantial air. The Dardan chiefs knew the god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his divine artillery, and heard his quiver hurtle as he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fled. So now at Phœbus’ present instance they check</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ascanius’ ardour for battle; themselves take their place</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the combat once more, and fling their lives into the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">jaws of danger. All over the walls passes the shout from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rampart to rampart; they bend their sharp-springing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bows and hurl their lashed javelins—the ground is all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strewn with darts; shields and hollow helms ring with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blow on blow; a savage combat is aroused; fierce as the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">fury hastens to the Dardan gate and the two haughty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brethren. Hurling his dart, he first slays Antiphates, who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">happened first to meet him, bastard son of great Sarpedon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by a Theban mother; the shaft of Italian cornel flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the yielding air, and lodging in the throat goes <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deep down into the chest; the wound’s dark pit spouts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forth a foaming torrent, and the cold steel grows warm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the lungs it pierces. Then with strong hand he slays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Merops and Erymas and then Aphidnus, then Bitias</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his blazing eyes and his boiling valour—not with a <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dart, for to a dart he would not have surrendered his life—no;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it was a whirled phalaric lance that came hurtling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fiercely, shot like a thunderbolt, which neither two bulls’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hides nor a trusty corselet with double golden plait could</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">withstand: the massive limbs sink and fall: earth groans, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the vast buckler thunders on the body. Even thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sometimes on Baiæ’s Eubœan coast falls a pile of stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which men compact with mighty blocks and then fling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into the sea; thus it comes down with protracted headlong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ruin, and dashing on the shallows settles into its <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">place; the sea is all disturbed, and the murky sand rises</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the surface; the crash shakes Prochyta<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> to her depths,</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now Mars, the lord of arms, inspires the Latians with <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strength and courage, and plants his stings deep in their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bosoms, while among the Teucrians, he sends Flight and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grisly Terror. They flock from this side and from that,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now that scope for battle is given, and the warrior-god</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comes down on their souls. When Pandarus saw his <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brother’s corpse laid low, and knew the posture of fortune</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the chance that was swaying the day, with a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">effort he turns the gate on its hinge, pushing with his broad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shoulders, and leaves outside many of his comrades shut out</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the camp all in the cruel battle, while others he shuts <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in with himself, admitting them as they stream onward—madman,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to have failed to see the king of the Rutulians in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the middle of the company storming in, and to have shut</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">him wantonly within the walls, like monstrous tiger</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among a herd of helpless cattle! On the instant a strange</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">light flashed from the eyes of the foe, and his arms gave a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fearful clang; on his helm quivers his crest, red as blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and from his shield he darts gleaming lightnings. With <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sudden confusion the children of Æneas recognize that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hated form and those giant limbs. Then forth springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty Pandarus, and with all the glow of wrath for his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brother’s death bespeaks him thus: “This is not the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bridal palace of Amata, nor is it Ardea that embraces <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus in the walls of his fathers; the enemy’s camp is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">before you; all escape is barred.” To him Turnus, smiling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in quiet mood: “Begin, if you have courage, and engage in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">combat. Priam shall learn from you that here too you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have found an Achilles.” Thus he: Pandarus, with the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">full strain of his power, hurls his spear, rugged with knots</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and unpeeled bark. It was launched on the air; but Saturnian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Juno turned aside the coming wound, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear lodged in the gate. “But this my weapon you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall not escape, swayed as it is by my hand’s full force; <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he from whom wound and weapon come is too strong for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that.” So cries Turnus, and rises high upon his lifted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword, and cleaves with the steel the forehead in twain full</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">between the temples, parting beardless cheek from cheek</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a ghastly wound. A crash is heard: earth is shaken <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the enormous weight: the unnerved limbs, the arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">splashed with gore and brain are stretched in death on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ground; and the head, shared in equal parts, hangs right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and left from either shoulder. The routed Trojans fly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here and there in wildering terror; and had the thought at <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once seized the conqueror, to burst the gates by main</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">force and give entrance to his friends, that day would have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ended a war and a nation both. But rage and mad thirst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for blood drove him in fury on the foe before him. First</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he surprises Phalaris and hamstrings Gyges; plucks forth <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spears and hurls them on the backs of the fliers; Juno</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gives supplies of strength and courage. He sends Halys to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">join them and Phegeus, pierced through the shield, and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">cuts down others as they stand unconscious on the walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and stir up the battle, Alcander and Halius, and Noëmon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Prytanis. As Lynceus moved to meet him and calls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on his comrades, with a sweep of his arm from the rampart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on his right he catches him with his whirling sword; swept <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">off by a single blow hand to hand, the head with the helmet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on it lay yards away. Next falls Amycus, the ravager of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the forest brood, than who was never man more skilled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to anoint the dart and arm the steel with venom, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clytius, son of Æolus, and Cretheus, darling of the Muses, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cretheus the Muses’ playmate, whose delight was ever in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">minstrelsy and harp, and in stringing notes on the chord;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">songs of chargers and warrior arms and battles were ever on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his lips.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At last the Teucrian leaders, hearing of the slaughter of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their men, come together to the spot, Mnestheus and keen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Serestus, when they see their comrades flying in confusion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the foe lodged in the camp. Out cries Mnestheus:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Whither now, whither are ye making in flight? what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">further city have ye, what walls beyond? Shall it be said <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that a single man, and he too, my countrymen, hemmed in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on all hands by your ramparts, has spread unavenged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">such havoc through your streets, has sent down to death so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">many of your bravest? As ye think of your unhappy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">country, your ancient gods, your great Æneas, is there no <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pity, no shame in your sluggish hearts?” Roused by these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">words they rally and halt in close array. Turnus step by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">step withdraws from the fight, making for the river and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the part round which the water runs. All the more keenly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Teucrians press on him with loud shouts and close their <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranks: as when a company of hunters bears down on a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">savage lion javelin in hand: he, struck with fear, yet fierce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and glaring angrily, gives ground; wrath and courage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suffer him not to turn his back, nor yet may he charge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">though he fain would do so, through the huntsmen and the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spears. Not unlike to him Turnus in doubt retraces his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lingering footsteps, while his heart boils with rage. Even</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then twice had he dashed on the thick of the foe, twice he</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">drives their ranks in huddled flight round the walls; but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole army musters in a body from the camp, nor dares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Saturnian Juno supply him with strength to oppose them;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for Jove sent down from the sky celestial Iris, with no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gentle message for his sister’s ear, if Turnus retire not from <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Teucrians’ lofty ramparts. So now the warrior cannot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hold his own with shield or sword; such a deluge of darts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">overwhelms him. Round his hollow temples the helmet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">echoes with ceaseless ringing; the solid plates of brass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give way beneath the stones; the horsehair crest is struck <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from his head; his shield’s boss cannot stand the blows;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">faster and faster they hail their spears, the Trojans and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fiery Mnestheus. Over all his frame flows the sweat and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trickles in a murky stream, while breathe he cannot; his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sinking limbs are shaken with feeble panting. At last <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with headlong leap he plunged arms and all into the river.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tiber with his yellow gulf received the guest, upbore him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on his buoyant waves, and washing off the stains of carnage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">restored him in joy to his friends.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime the palace of strong Olympus is thrown open,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">camp of the Dardans and the people of Latium. They <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">take their seats in the double-gated mansion; he himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">opens the court: “Mighty denizens of heaven, wherefore</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is your judgment turned backward, and whence such discord</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in your unkindly souls? I had forbidden that Italy</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus Jupiter in brief; but not brief was the answer <span class="linenum">20</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the gates, amidst the very mounds of the ramparts combat</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the walls of our infant Troy, with a second army; once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more Tydeus’ son from his Ætolian Arpi is rising against</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Teucrians. Ay, my wounds, I ween, are yet in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">future, and I, thine own offspring, am delaying the destined</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">despite your will that the Trojans have won their way to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italy, let them expiate the crime and withdraw from them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thine aid: but if they have but followed those many oracles</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">can any now be able to reverse thine ordinance and write <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">anew the page of fate? Why should I remind thee of our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fleet consumed on Eryx’ shore? why of the monarch of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">storms and his raving winds stirred up from Æolia, or of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iris sent down from the clouds? Now she is even rousing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the ghosts below—that portion of the world till then was <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">untried—and on a sudden Allecto is launched on upper</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">air, and rages through the Italian cities. It is not for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">empire that I am disquieted; for that we hoped in the past,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while our star yet shone: let them conquer whom thou</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">let me send away Ascanius safe from the war—let my</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">on unknown waters, and follow such course as chance may <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">give him: <i>him</i> let me have the power to screen and withdraw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the horrors of battle. Amathus is mine, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lofty Paphos, and high Cythera, and the mansion of Idalia:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there let him pass his days unwarlike and inglorious. Let</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">her tyrannous sway; the Tyrian cities need fear no resistance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from him. What has it advantaged him to have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">escaped the plague of war and fled through the hottest of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Argive fires, to have drained to the dregs all those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dangers by sea and on broad earth, while the Teucrians <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are in quest of Latium and a restored Pergamus? Give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back, great sire, to our wretched nation their Xanthus and</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">by fierce passion: “Why force you me to break my deep</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Tyrrhenian loyalty and stir up a quiet nation? What</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">hurt? is there a trace of Juno here, or of Iris sent down from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the clouds? Ay, it is foul shame that the Italians should</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">while with her left she paddles in the noiseless wave.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then thus she breaks on his wondering ear: “Wake you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas, seed of the gods? be wakeful still, and let the sail-ropes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">go. We it is you see, pines of Ida from the sacred <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">summit, Sea-nymphs now, your sometime fleet. When</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">lives to lead beneath the water. Meantime young Ascanius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is hemmed in by rampart and trench, with serried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapons all around him, and Latians bristling with battle.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Already the Arcadian horse mixed with the brave Etruscan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has gained the appointed spot: to bar their way with an <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">intervening host and cut them off from the camp is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus’ fixed intent. Rise, and with the earliest approach</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of dawn bid your allies be summoned to arms, and take in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand that shield which the Fire-god himself made to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">morrow’s sun, if you will but give credence to my words,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall survey mighty heaps of Rutulian carnage.” Her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">speech was done: and as she parted she gave with her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand an impulse to the lofty stern, well knowing the due</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">measure of force: on it speeds over the wave, fleeter than <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dart and wind-swift arrow both. The rest in order mend</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their speed. Wondering he pauses, the great Trojan of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anchises’ line, yet cheers his soul with the omen. Then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">looking to the vault above, he prays in brief: “Gracious</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">much he said: and meanwhile day was returning at speed, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">mighty fires, even as when on a clear night blood-hued</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comets glare with gloomy red, or as the Sirian blaze,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that harbinger of drought and sickness to weak mortality,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and upbraid: “See here the occasion you longed for, to</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">rise on their oars and bear down on the Latian plains with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vessels all foam, till the beaks have gained the dry land, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and every keel has come scatheless to its rest. Not so</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy ship, Tarchon: for while dashed on a sandbank it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">totters on the unequal ridge, poised in suspense awhile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and buffeting the waves, its sides give way, and its men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are set down in the midst of the water: broken oars and <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">floating benches entangle them, and their feet are carried</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back by the ebb of the wave.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">No sluggish delay holds Turnus from his work: with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fiery speed he sweeps his whole army against the Teucrians,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and plants them in the foe’s face on the shore. The <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clarions sound: first dashed Æneas on the rustic ranks, a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presage of the fight’s fortune, and disarrayed the Latians,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slaying Theron, who in his giant strength is assailing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas: piercing through quilted brass and tunic stiff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with gold the sword devours his unguarded side. Next <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he strikes Lycus, who was cut from the womb of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dead mother and consecrated to thee, Apollo, because his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">baby life had been suffered to scape the peril of the steel.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hard by, as iron Cisseus and gigantic Gyas were laying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">low his host with their clubs, he casts them down in <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">death: nought availed them; the weapons of Hercules or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strong hands to wield them, or Melampus their sire,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alicides’ constant follower, long as earth found for him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those grievous tasks. See there, as Pharus is hurling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forth words without deeds, he flings at him his javelin <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and plants it in the bawler’s mouth. Thou, too, Cydon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while following with ill-starred quest the blooming Clytius,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy latest joy, hadst lain stretched on the ground by the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Dardan hand, a piteous spectacle, at rest from the passions</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that were ever in thy heart; but thy brethren met</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the foe in close band, the progeny of Phorcus: seven their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">number, seven the darts they throw; some rebound idly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from shield and helm, some as they grazed the frame were <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turned aside by Venus’ gentle power. Quick spoke</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas to true Achates: “Give me store of weapons; not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one shall my hand hurl in vain against the Rutulians, of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all that have quivered in Grecian flesh on the plains of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy.” With that he seizes his mighty spear and launches <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it: flying on it crashes through the brass of Mæon’s shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and rends breastplate and breast at once. Swift comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his brother Alcanor and props with his hand the falling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man: piercing the arm the spear flies onward and holds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its bloody course, and the dying hand dangles by the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sinews from the shoulder-blade. Then Numitor, snatching</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the javelin from his brother’s body, assails Æneas;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yet it might not lodge in the enemy’s front, but just</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grazed the thigh of mighty Achates.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Now comes Clausus of Cures in the pride of his youthful <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame, and strikes Dryops from a distance under the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chin with the strong impact of his stark spear, and piercing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his throat, robs him even as he speaks of life and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breath alike: the wounded man strikes the earth with</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Three, too, from Thrace, of Boreas’ noblest lineage, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">three sent to battle by Idas their sire and Ismarus their</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">these, now those, strain to win the ground: the struggle is</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">grips, front to front: even such the meeting of the army</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But in another part of the field, where a torrent had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scattered wide whirling stones and trees uprooted from its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">banks, soon as Pallas saw his Arcadians, unused to wage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war on foot, flying before the chase of Latium, in that the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cragginess of the soil had driven them to discard their <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steeds, he tries the one remedy in sore distress, and now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with prayers, now with bitter speeches, inflames their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">valour: “Whither fly ye, mates? By your gallant deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I conjure you—by your chief Evander’s name and victories</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">won at his bidding—by my own promise, now <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shooting up in rivalry with my father’s glory—trust not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to your feet. It is the sword that must hew us a way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the foe. Where yonder host of men presses in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thickest mass is the path by which our noble country is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">calling you and your general Pallas back to her arms. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No deities sit heavy on us: by a mortal foe we are pressed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mortals ourselves: we have as many lives, as many hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as they. Lo there! the sea hems us in with mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ocean-barrier; earth is closed to our flight: shall the sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or Troy be our goal?” This said, he dashes at the midst <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the hostile throng. The first that meets him is Lagus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brought to the spot by fates unkind; him, while tugging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a stone of enormous weight, he pierces with his whirled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">javelin, just where the spine running down the back was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">parting the ribs, and recovers the weapon from its lodgment <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among the bones. Nor can Hisbo surprise him in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fact, spite of his hopes; for Pallas catches him rushing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on in blind fury for the pain of his comrade’s death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and buries the sword in his distended lungs. Next his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blow lights on Sthenelus, and Anchemolus of Rhœtus’ <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ancient line, who dared pollute his stepdame’s couch.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You, too, twin brethren, fell on those Rutulian plains,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Larides and Thymber, Daucus’ resemblant offspring, undistinguished</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">those who bore you: but now Pallas has marked you with <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a cruel difference; for you, poor Thymber, have your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">head shorn off by the Evandrian sword; your hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Larides, severed from the arm, is looking in vain for you</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">its master; the fingers, half alive, are quivering yet and</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Arcadia’s sons, stung by their chief’s rebuke and gazing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on his glorious deeds, rush on the foe, strong in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armour of mingled rage and shame. Then Pallas strikes <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through Rhœtus as he flies past him on his car. So</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">much space and respite from his end did Ilus gain; for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’twas at Ilus he had launched from the distance his stalwart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear: Rhœtus comes between and catches it, flying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from thee, noble Teuthras, and Tyres thy brother; and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tumbled from his car he beats with his dying heel the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulian plains. Even as when the winds have risen at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his wish on a summer’s day, a shepherd lets loose his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scattered flames among the woods, in a moment catching</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all that comes between, the Fire-god’s army in one bristling <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">line stretches over the broad plains: he from his seat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beholds the triumphant blaze with a conqueror’s pride:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">even so the valour of thy friends musters from all sides on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one point to aid thee, Pallas. But Halesus, that fiery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warrior, moves against their opposing ranks, gathering <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself up into his arms. Ladon he massacres, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pheres, and Demodocus: Strymonius’ right hand, raised</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against his throat, he lops away with his gleaming sword;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a stone he strikes the front of Thoas, and has crushed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bones mixed with gory brain. Halesus had been <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hidden in the woods by his prophetic sire; when the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">old man closed his whitening eyes in death, the Fates</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">claimed their victim, and devoted him to Evander’s darts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And now Pallas aims at him, after these words of prayer:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grant, Father Tiber, to the flying steel poised in my <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand a prosperous passage through Halesus’ hardy breast;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thine oak shall have his arms and his warrior spoils.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The god gave ear: while Halesus shielded Imaon, he gives</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his own breast in evil hour unarmed to the Arcadian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lance. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Lausus, himself a mighty portion of the war, suffers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not his troops to be dismayed by the hero’s dreadful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage: first he slays Abas, who had met him front to</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">front, the breakwater and barrier of fight. Down go the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sons of Arcadia, down go the Etruscans, and ye, too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teucrians, whose frames Greece could not destroy. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armies clash, their leaders and their powers the same.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The rear ranks close up the battle; nor weapon nor hand <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">can be moved for the crowd. Here is Pallas pushing and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pressing, there Lausus over against him: their years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scarcely differ; each has a comely form; but Fortune had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">already written that neither should return to his home.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet were they not suffered to meet man to man by great <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Olympus’ lord: each has his fate assigned him ere long at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hand of a mightier enemy.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus meanwhile is warned by his gracious sister to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">come to Lausus’ aid; and with his flying car he cleaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the intervening ranks. Soon as he met his comrades’ <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eye: “You may rest from battle now; I alone am coming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against Pallas. Pallas is my due, and mine alone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">would that his sire were here to see us fight.” He said;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his friends retired from the interdicted space. But</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the Rutulians withdraw, the young warrior, marvelling <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the haughty command, gazes astonished on Turnus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rolls his eyes over that giant frame, and sweeps the whole</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man from afar with fiery glance, and with words like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these meets the words of the monarch: “I shall soon be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">famous either for kingly trophies won or for an illustrious <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">death; my sire is equal to either event; a truce to menace.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This said, he marches into the middle space; while the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arcadians’ blood chills and curdles about their hearts.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down from his car leaps Turnus, and addresses himself to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fight on foot. And as when a lion has seen from a high <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">watch-tower a bull standing at distance in the field and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">meditating fight, he flies to the spot, even thus looks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus as he bounds along.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as he judged his foe would be within reach of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear-throw, Pallas begins the combat, in hope that Fortune <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may help the venture of unequal powers, and utters</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these words to the mighty heaven: “By my sire’s hospitality</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the board where thou satest as a stranger, I</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">pray thee, Alcides, stand by me in my great endeavour.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let Turnus see me strip the bloody arms from his dying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame, and may his glazing eyes endure the sight of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a conqueror.” Alcides heard the youth, and stifled a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavy groan deep down in his breast, and shed forth unavailing <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tears. Then the Almighty Father bespeaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his son with kindly words: “Each has his fixed day:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">short and irretrievable is the span of all men; but to propagate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glory by great deeds, this is what worth can do.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Think of those many sons of gods who fell beneath Troy’s <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lofty walls: among whom died even Sarpedon, my own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">offspring. For Turnus, too, the call of his destiny has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gone forth, and he has reached the term of his allotted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">days.” So he speaks, and turns away his eyes from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulian plain. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Pallas with a mighty effort sends forth his spear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and plucks from the hollow scabbard his flashing sword.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On flies the weapon, strikes where the margin of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">harness rises toward the shoulder, and forcing its way</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the buckler’s edge, at last even grazed the mighty <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame of Turnus. Then Turnus, long poising his beam</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with its point of sharp steel, hurls it at Pallas, with these</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">words: “See whether our weapon be not the keener.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So he: while cleaving those many plates of iron and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brass, spite of the bull-hides wound oft and oft about, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the point strikes through the shield’s midst with quivering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">impact, and pierces the corselet’s barrier and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty breast beyond. In vain the youth tears the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reeking dart from the wound: as it parts, blood and life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">follow on its track. He falls forward on his wound: his <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms resound upon him, and with his bloody jaws in death</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he bites the hostile earth. Standing over him, Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">began: “Men of Arcady, take heed and carry my words</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Evander: I send back Pallas handled as his sire deserves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If there be any honour in a tomb, any solace in <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">burial, let him take it freely; his welcome of Æneas will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be costly notwithstanding.” Then with his left foot as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he spoke, he trod on the dead, tearing away the belt’s</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">huge weight and the crime thereon engraved<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a>: that band</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of youths slain foully all on one wedding night, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chambers dabbled with blood: Clonus Eurytides had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chased it on the broad field of gold: and now Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">triumphs in the prize, and exults in his winning. Blind <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are the eyes of man’s soul to destiny and doom to be, nor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">knows it to respect the limit, when upborne by prosperous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fortune! Turnus shall see the day when he will fain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have paid a high price for Pallas unharmed, when he will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hate the spoils and the hour he won them! But Pallas’ <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">followers, with many a groan and tear, are bearing off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their chief on his shield in long procession. Oh, vision of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sorrow and great glory, soon to meet thy father’s eye!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this day first gave thee to battle, this day withdraws the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gift, yet vast are the heaps thou leavest of Rutulian <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now not the mere rumour of a blow so dreadful,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but surer intelligence flies to Æneas, that his army is but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a hand-breadth’s remove from death—that it is high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">time to succour the routed Teucrians. With his sword he <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mows down all that crosses him, and all on fire hews a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broad pathway through the ranks with the steel, seeking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thee, Turnus, fresh flushed with slaughter. Pallas, Evander,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole scene stands before his eyes—the board</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where he had first sate as a stranger, the outstretched <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hands of fellowship. At once he takes alive four youths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">born of Sulmo, and other four reared by Ufens, that he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may offer them as victims to the dead, and sprinkle the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">funeral flame with their captive gore. Next he had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">levelled his spear from afar at Magus. Magus deftly runs <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beneath, while the quivering spear flies over his head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and clasping the enemy’s knees, utters these words of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suppliance: “By your dead father’s soul, and the dawning</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">promise of Iulus, I pray you spare my poor life for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my son and my sire. I have a lofty palace: deep in its <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vaults lie talents of chased silver; masses of gold are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mine, wrought and unwrought both. The victory of Troy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hangs not on my fortunes, nor can a single life make</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">difference so great.” He spoke, and Æneas thus makes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reply: “Those many talents you name of silver and gold,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keep them for your sons. Turnus was the first to put an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">end to such trading usages of war at the moment when he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slew Pallas. My sire Anchises’ ghost, and my son Iulus, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">speak their thoughts through me.” This said, with his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left hand he grasps the helmet and drives his sword hilt-deep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the suppliant’s back-drawn neck. Hard by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was Hæmonides, priest of Phœbus and Trivia, his temples</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wreathed with the fillet’s sacred band, glittering all over <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with gay raiment and goodly armour. Him he meets,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drives over the plain, stands over him fallen, sacrifices</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the victim, and whelms him in a mighty shade; the arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are stripped and carried off on Serestus’ shoulders, a trophy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to thee, royal Gradivus. The ranks are rallied by Cæculus, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scion of Vulcan’s stock, and Umbro, who comes from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Volscian hills. The Dardan chief puts forth his rage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against them. Already had he mowed down with his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword Anxur’s left hand and the whole orb of the shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he bore—that foe, I ween, had uttered a haughty boast, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and deemed that his hand would second his tongue, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was swelling in spirit to the stars, with an assured hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of gray hairs and length of days—when Tarquitus, in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pride of gleaming armour, borne by the nymph Dryope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to woodland Faunus, crossed his fiery path. Drawing <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back his spear, he hampers the corselet and the buckler’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weighty mass; then he sweeps to the ground the head,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the lips were vainly praying and essaying to say a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thousand things, and dashing before him the reeking trunk,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">utters thus the fierceness of his heart: “Lie there, doughty <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warrior! never shall your tender mother give you burial,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or pile your father’s tomb above your limbs; no, you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will be left to savage birds, or the river will carry you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whelmed by its eddies, and hungry fish will lick your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wounds.” Next he hunts down Antæus and Lucas, of <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus’ first rank, and gallant Numa, and yellow Camers,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">son of noble Volscens, who was wealthiest in land of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonia’s children, and reigned over voiceless Amyclæ.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Even as Ægæon, who, fable tells, had a hundred arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a hundred hands, and flashed fire through fifty mouths</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the depths of fifty bosoms, what time against Jove’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lightning he thundered on fifty strong shields, and drew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forth fifty sharp swords, so Æneas slakes his victorious <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fury the whole field over, when once his blade had grown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warm with blood. See! he is advancing against Niphæus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">four harnessed steeds, and setting his breast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">against theirs. At once they, soon as they saw his lofty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stride and his fierce gestures, turn round affrighted, and, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rushing backward, unseat their master and hurry the car</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the beach. Meanwhile Lucagus forces his way into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the midst, drawn by two white horses, with Liger his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brother; but the brother guides the steeds with the rein,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while Lucagus sweeps fiercely round his naked sword. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas brooked not the fury of their fiery onset, but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rushed against them, and stood fronting them in his giant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bulk with threatening spear. To him cried Liger: “These</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are not Diomede’s steeds you see, nor this Achilles’ chariot,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor are these the Phrygian plains; your warfare and <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your life shall end here on Italian ground.” So fly abroad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the random words of frantic Liger. The chief of Troy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seeks not to meet him with words, but hurls his javelin</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the foe. Even as Lucagus, bending forward over the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stroke, pricked on his horses with the steel, and advancing <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his left foot prepares himself for fight, the spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pierces the last margin of the radiant shield and enters</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the groin at the left: down he falls from the car and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wallows in death on the plain; while good Æneas bespeaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him with words of gall: “So, Lucagus, it is no <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">craven flight of your steeds that has played your car false;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no empty shadow cast by the foe has turned them; no,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it is you that spring down from the wheels, and leave the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horses to their fate.” With these words he laid hold of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bridles, while the wretched brother, gliding down <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the car, was stretching his recreant hands: “Oh, by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yourself, by the parents that gave such greatness birth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spare this poor life, brave hero of Troy, and let prayer</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">find compassion.” Æneas cut short his entreaties; “Not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">such were your words a moment ago; die, and forsake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not your brother, as brother should:” and cleaving the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bosom with his sword, he laid bare the seat of breath.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such were the deaths that the Dardan leader dealt about <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the plains, storming along like torrent wave or murky</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tempest. At length the prisoners burst forth and leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their camp, the young Ascanius and the soldiery beleaguered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in vain.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Jupiter meanwhile first addresses Juno: “Sister mine <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sweetest wife in one, Venus it is, even as thou didst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suppose—for thy judgment is never at fault—that upholds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the powers of the Trojans, not the warriors’ own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">keen right hand and the courageous soul that braves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">every peril.” Juno returned, meekly: “Why, my fairest <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lord, dost thou vex a sick spirit that quails before thy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cruel speeches? Had my love the force it once had, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which should still be its own, this at least thou wouldst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not deny me, almighty as thou art, the power to withdraw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus from the fight and preserve him in safety <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for Daunus his father. As it is, let him perish, and glut</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Teucrian vengeance with his righteous blood. Yet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he draws his name from our lineage, and Pilumnus is his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grandsire’s grandsire: and often has thy temple been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loaded with store of offerings from his bounteous hand.” <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom, in brief reply, the lord of skyey Olympus: “If</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy prayer for the doomed youth is respite and breathing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">space from present death, and so thou readest my will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bear thou Turnus away in flight, and snatch him from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the destiny that presses on his heels. Thus far is room <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for compliance. But if any deeper favour be hidden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under these prayers of thine, and thou deemest that the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war’s whole course can be moved or changed, thou art</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nursing an empty hope.” Juno answered with tears:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“What if thy heart were to grant what thy tongue grudges, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Turnus’ life were pledged to continue? As it is, a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heavy doom hangs over his guiltless head, or I am void</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of truth and wandering in delusion. But oh, that I</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">might rather be the sport of lying terrors, and thou, who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">canst, lead back thy counsels by a better road!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This said, from the lofty sky she shot forthwith, driving</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">storm before her through the air and girt with the rain-cloud,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sought the army of Ilium and the camp of <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laurentum. Then, as goddesses may, she fashions a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thin, strengthless shadow of hollow cloud in the likeness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Æneas, a marvel to the eyes, accoutres it with Dardan</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapons, and counterfeits the shield and the crest of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">god-like head, gives it empty words and tones without <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soul, and renders to the life the step and the gait: even</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the shapes that are said to flit when death is past, or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the dreams that mock the sense of slumber. So the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">phantom strides triumphant in the van, goading the enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with brandished weapons and defiant speech. Turnus <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comes on, and hurls from far his hurtling spear; it turns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its back and retires. Then, when Turnus thought Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flying in retreat, and snatched in the vehemence of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soul at the empty hope: “Whither so fast, Æneas?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cries he: “nay, leave not your promised bridal; this <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand shall give you the soil you have sought for the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ocean over.” So with loud shouts he follows, waving his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drawn sword, nor sees that the winds are bearing off his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">triumph. It chanced that a ship was standing moored to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the edge of a lofty rock, its ladder let down, its bridge <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ready to cross—the ship which had carried king Osinius</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the borders of Clusium. Hither, as in haste, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">semblance of the flying Æneas plunged for shelter. Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">follows as fast, bounds over all obstacles, and springs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">across the high-raised bridge. Scarce had he touched the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prow when Saturn’s daughter breaks the mooring and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sweeps the sundered ship along the receding flood. Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">meanwhile is claiming the combat with his absent foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sending down to death many a warrior frame that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crosses his way. Then the airy phantom seeks shelter no <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">longer, but soaring aloft blends with the murky atmosphere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while Turnus is borne by the wind down the middle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the tide. Ignorant of the event, and unthankful for</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">escape, he looks back, his hands and his voice addressed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the sky: “Almighty sire! hast thou judged me worthy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of an infliction like this, and sentenced me to this depth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of suffering? Whither am I bound? whence have I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">come? what is this flight that is bearing me home, and <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what does it make of me? Shall I look again on Laurentum’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">camp and city? what of that warrior troop who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">followed me and my standard? Are they not those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whom I left—horror to tell—all of them in the jaws</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of a cruel death—whom I now see scattered in rout, and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hear their groans as they fall? What can I do? what</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lowest depth of earth will yawn for me? Nay, do you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ye winds, have compassion—on reef, on rock—see, it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is I, Turnus, who am fain to plead—dash me this vessel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and lodge it on the sandbank’s ruthless shoal, where none <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that know my shame, Rutuli or rumour, may find me</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">out!” So speaking, he sways in spirit to this side and to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that: should he for disgrace so foul impale his frenzied</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breast on the sword’s point, and drive the stark blade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through his ribs, or fling himself into the midst of the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">waves, and make by swimming for the winding shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and place himself again among the Teucrian swords?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice he essayed either way: thrice mighty Juno kept</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him back, and of her great pity withheld the youth from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">action. On he flies, ploughing the deep with wave and <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tide to speed him, and is borne safely to the ancient town</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Daunus his sire.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">when Cisseus’ royal daughter, teeming with a firebrand, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gave birth to Paris; he sleeps beneath his father’s walls,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">on the reedy jungle, soon as he finds himself among the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">back; none has the courage to flame forth and come near</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him; at safe distance they press him with their darts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and their cries; even so of them who hate Mezentius with <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a righteous hate, none has the heart to face him with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drawn steel; with missiles and deafening shouts they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">assail him from afar; while he, undaunted, is pausing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now here, now there, gnashing his teeth, and shakes off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the javelins from his buckler’s hide. There was one <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Acron from Corythus’ ancient borders, a Grecian wight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who had fled forth leaving his nuptials yet to celebrate;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him, when Mezentius saw at distance scattering the intervening</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranks, in pride of crimson plumage and the purple</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of his plighted bride, even as oft a famished lion ranging <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through high-built stalls—for frantic hunger is his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prompter—if he chance to mark a flying goat or towering-antlered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deer, grins with huge delight, sets up his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mane, and hangs over the rent flesh, while loathly blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">laves his insatiate jaws—so joyfully springs Mezentius <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the foe’s clustering mass. Down goes ill-starred Acron,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spurns the blackened ground in the pangs of death, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dyes with blood the broken spear. Nor did the chief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deign to strike down Orodes as he fled, or deal from a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear-throw a wound unseen; full in front he meets him, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and engages him as man should man, prevailing not by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">guile but by sheer force of steel. Then with foot and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lance planted on the back-flung body: “See, gallants, a</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">bulwark of the war has fallen in tall Orodes,” and his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comrades shout in unison, taking up the triumphal pæan.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The dying man returns: “Whoever thou art, thy victorious</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">too, a like fate is watching, and thou shalt soon lie on <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these self-same fields.” Mezentius answers, with hate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mantling in his smile: “Die now. The sire of gods and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king of men shall make his account with me.” So saying,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he drew forth the spear from the body: the heavy rest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of iron slumber settles down on its eyes, and their beams <span class="linenum">10</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">there over against her Saturnian Juno. Tisiphone, ashy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pale, is raving among thousands down below. But see!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mezentius, shaking his giant spear, is striding into the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">field, an angry presence. Think of the stature of Orion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he overtops the billows with his shoulders, when he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stalks on foot through the very heart of Nereus’ mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">depths that part before him, or as carrying an aged ash</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in triumph from the hill-top he plants his tread on the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ground, and hides his head among the clouds above:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus it is that Mezentius in enormous bulk shoulders his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">way. Æneas spies him along the length of the battle,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and makes haste to march against him. He abides undismayed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">waiting for his gallant foe, and stands like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">column on its base; then, measuring with his eye the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">distance that may suffice for his spear, “Now let my right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand, the god of my worship, and the missile dart I am <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">poising, vouchsafe their aid! I vow that you, my Lausus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clad in spoils torn from yonder robber’s carcase, shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stand in your own person the trophy of Æneas.” He</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">said, and threw from far his hurtling lance: flying onward,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it glances aside from the shield, and strikes in the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">distance noble Antores twixt side and flank, Antores,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comrade of Hercules, who, sent from Argos, had cloven to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Evander’s fortunes and sat him down in an Italian home.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now he falls, ill-fated, by a wound meant for other, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gazes on the sky, and dreams in death of his darling Argos. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then good Æneas hurls his spear; through the hollow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">disk with its triple plating of brass, through the folds of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">linen and the texture wherein three bulls joined, it won</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its way and lodged low down in the groin, but its force</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">held not on. In a moment Æneas, gladdened by the sight <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the Tuscan’s blood, plucks his sword from his thigh</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and presses hotly on his unnerved foe.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as Lausus saw, he gave a heavy groan of tenderness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the sire he loved, and tears trickled down his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">face. And here, gallant youth, neither the cruel chance <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of thy death, nor thy glorious deeds, if antiquity may</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gain credence for so great a sacrifice, nor thine own most</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">worthy memory shall be unsung through fault of mine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The father, dragging back his foot, disabled and entangled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was quitting the field, his enemy’s spearshaft trailing <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from his buckler. Forth dashed the youth and mingled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the duel, and even as Æneas was rising with hand and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">body and bringing down a blow from above, met the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shock of the sword, and gave the swordsman pause; his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comrades second him with a mighty shout, covering the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father’s retreat as sheltered by his son’s shield he withdraws</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the fray, hurl a rain of darts, and strive with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">distant missiles to dislodge the foe. Æneas glows with</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">anger, and keeps within the covert of his arms. Even as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on a time when storm-clouds sweep down in a burst of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hail, every ploughman, every husbandman has fled scattering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the field, and the traveller lies hid in a stronghold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of safety, either some river bank or vault of lofty <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rock, while the rain is pelting on the lands, in the hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that with the returning sun they may task the day once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more; even so, stormed on by javelins from all sides,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas endures the thunder-cloud of war till all its artillery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be spent, and keeps chiding Lausus and threatening <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lausus: “Whither are you rushing on your death, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aims beyond your strength? Your duteous heart blinds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your reckless valour.” Yet he bates not a jot in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frantic onslaught: and now the Dardan leader’s wrath</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">surges into fury, and the fatal sisters are gathering up <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lausus’ last thread, for Æneas drives his forceful blade</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sheer through the youth’s body, and buries it wholly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">within him. Pierced is the shield by the edge, the light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armour he carried so threateningly, and the tunic embroidered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by his mother with delicate golden thread, and <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his bosom is deluged with blood; and anon the life flits</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the air regretfully to the shades and the body is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">left tenantless. But when the son of Anchises saw the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">look and countenance of the dying—the countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with its strange and varying hues of pallor—heavily he <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaned for pity and stretched forth his hand, and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">portraiture of filial love stood before his soul. “What</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now, hapless boy, what shall the good Æneas give you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">worthy of your merit and of a heart like yours? Let the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms wherein you took pride be your own still; yourself <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I restore to the company of your ancestors, their shades</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and their ashes, if that be aught to you now. This at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">least, ill-starred as you are, shall solace the sadness of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your death: it is great Æneas’ hand that brings you low.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then without more ado he chides the slackness of his <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comrades, and lifts their young chief from the earth, as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he lay dabbling his trim locks with gore.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile the father at the wave of Tiber’s flood was</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">stanching his wounds with water, and giving ease to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame, leaning on a tree’s trunk. His brazen helmet is hanging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from a distant bough, and his heavy arms are resting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the mead. Round him stand his bravest warriors: he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sick and panting, is relieving his neck, while his flowing <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beard scatters over his bosom: many a question asks he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">about Lausus, many a messenger he sends to call him off</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and convey to him the charge of his grieving sire. But</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lausus the while was being carried breathless on his shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by a train of weeping comrades, a mighty spirit quelled by <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a mighty wound. The distant groan told its tale to that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ill-boding heart. He defiles his gray hairs with a shower</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of dust, stretches his two palms to heaven, and clings to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the body. “My son! and was I enthralled by so strong a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">love of life as to suffer you, mine own offspring, to meet the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foeman’s hand in my stead? Are these your wounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">preserving your sire? is he living through your death?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Alas! now at length I know the misery of banishment!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now the iron is driven home! Aye, it was I, my son, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stained your name with guilt, driven by the hate I gendered <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the throne and realm of my father! Retribution</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was due to my country and to my subjects’ wrath: would</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that I had let out my forfeit life through all the death-wounds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they aimed! And now I live on, nor as yet leave</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">daylight and humankind—but leave them I will.” So <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">saying, he raises himself on his halting thigh, and though</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the deep wound makes his strength flag, calls for his war-horse</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with no downcast mien. This was ever his glory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his solace: this still carried him victorious from every</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle-field. He addresses the grieving creature and bespeaks <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it thus: “Long, Rhæbus, have we twain lived, if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aught be long to those who must die. To-day you shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">either bear in victory the bloody spoils and head of Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yonder, and join with me to avenge my Lausus’ sufferings,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or if our force suffice not to clear the way, we will lie down <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">together in death: for never, I ween, my gallant one, will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you stoop to a stranger’s bidding and endure a Teucrian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lord.” He said, and mounting on its back settled his limbs</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he was wont, and charged his two hands with pointed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">javelins, his head shining with brass and shaggy with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horse-hair crest. So he bounded into the midst—his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heart glowing at once with mighty shame, madness and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">agony commingled. Then with a loud voice he thrice <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">called on Æneas: aye, and Æneas knew it, and prays in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ecstasy: “May the great father of the gods, may royal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo grant that you come to the encounter!” So</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">much said, he marches to meet him with brandished spear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The other replies: “Why terrify me, fellest of foes, now <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you have robbed me of my son? this was the only way by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which you could work my ruin. I fear not death, nor give</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quarter to any deity. Enough: I am coming to die, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">send you this my present first.” He said, and flung a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">javelin at his enemy: then he sends another and another <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to its mark, wheeling round in a vast ring: but the golden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shield bides the blow. Three times, wheeling from right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to left, he rode round the foe that faced him, flinging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">darts from his hand: three times the hero of Troy moves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round, carrying with him a vast grove planted on his <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brazen plate. Then, when he begins to tire of the long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">delay and the incessant plucking out of darts, and feels the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unequal combat press him hard, meditating many things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at last he springs from his covert, and hurls his spear full</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">between the hollow temples of the warrior-steed. The <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gallant beast rears itself upright, lashes the air with its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heels, and, flinging the rider, falls on and encumbers him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and itself bowed to earth presses with its shoulder the prostrate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chief. Up flies Æneas, plucks forth his sword from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its scabbard, and bespeaks the fallen: “Where now is <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fierce Mezentius and that his savage vehemence of spirit?”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To whom the Tuscan, soon as opening his eyes on the light</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he drank in the heaven and regained his sense: “Insulting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foe, why reproach me and menace me with death? You</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may kill me without crime: I came not to battle to be <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spared, nor was that the league which my Lausus ratified</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with you for his father. One boon I ask, in the name of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that grace, if any there be, which is due to a vanquished</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">enemy: suffer my corpse to be interred. The hot hatred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of my subjects, well I know, is blazing all round me: screen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me, I pray, from their fury, and vouchsafe me a share in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the tomb of my son.” So saying, with full resolve he welcomes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sword to his throat, and spreads his life over his <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armour in broad streams of blood.</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile, the Goddess of Dawn has risen and left the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ocean. Æneas, though duty presses to find leisure for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">interring his friends, and his mind is still wildered by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scene of blood, was paying his vows to heaven as conqueror</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should at the day-star’s rise. A giant oak, lopped all <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round of its branches, he sets up on a mound, and arrays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it in gleaming arms, the royal spoils of Mezentius, a trophy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to thee, great Lord of War: thereto he attaches the crest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yet raining blood, the warrior’s weapons notched and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broken, and the hauberk stricken and pierced by twelve <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">several wounds: to the left hand he binds the brazen shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and hangs to the neck the ivory-hilted sword. Then he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">begins thus to give charge to his triumphant friends, for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole company of chiefs had gathered to his side:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“A mighty deed, gallants, is achieved already: dismiss <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all fear for the future: see here the spoils, the tyrant’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">first-fruits: see here Mezentius as my hands have made</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him. Now our march is to the king and the walls of Latium.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Set the battle in array in your hearts and let hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forestall the fray, that no delay may check your ignorance <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the moment when heaven gives leave to pluck up the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">consign we to earth the unburied carcases of our friends,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that solitary honour which is held in account in the pit <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Acheron. Go,” he says, “grace with the last tribute</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those glorious souls, who have bought for us this our fatherland</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the price of their blood: and first to Evander’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sorrowing town send we Pallas, who, lacking nought of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">manly worth, has been reft by the evil day, and whelmed <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in darkness before his time.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So he says weeping, and returns to his tent-door, where</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the body of breathless Pallas, duly laid out, was being</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">watched by Acœtes the aged, who had in old days been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armour-bearer to Evander his Arcadian lord, but then in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an hour less happy was serving as the appointed guardian <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the pupil he loved. Around the corpse were thronging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the retinue of menials and the Trojan train, and dames</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Ilion with their hair unbound in mourning fashion.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But soon as Æneas entered the lofty portal, a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wail they raise to the stars, smiting on their breasts, and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the royal dwelling groans to its centre with their agony</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of woe. He, when he saw the pillowed head and countenance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Pallas in his beauty, and the deep cleft of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonian spear in his marble bosom, thus speaks, breaking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into tears: “Can it be, unhappy boy, that Fortune at the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moment of her triumphant flood-tide has grudged you to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me, forbidding you to look on my kingdom, and ride back</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">victorious to your father’s home? Not such was the parting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pledge I gave on your behalf to your sire Evander, when,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clasping me to his heart, he sent me on my way to mighty <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">empire, and anxiously warned me that the foe was fierce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the race we should war with stubborn. And now he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">belike at this very moment in the deep delusion of empty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hope is making vows to Heaven and piling the altars with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gifts, while we are following his darling, void of life, and <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">owing no dues henceforward to any power on high, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the vain service of our sorrow. Ill-starred father! your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eyes shall see what cruel death has made of your son.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And is this the proud return, the triumph we looked for?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has my solemn pledge shrunk to this? Yet no beaten <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coward shall you see, Evander, chastised with unseemly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wounds, nor shall the father pray for death to come in its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">terror while the son survives. Ay me! how strong a defender</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is lost to our Ausonian realm, and lost to you, my</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So having wailed his fill, he gives order to lift and bear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the poor corpse, and sends a thousand men chosen from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his whole array to attend the last service of woe, and lend</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">their countenance to the father’s tears, a scant solace for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that mighty sorrow, yet not the less the wretched parent’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">due. Others, nothing slack, plait the framework of a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pliant bier with shoots of arbute and oaken twigs, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shroud the heaped-up bed with a covering of leaves. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Here place they the youth raised high on his rustic litter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">even as a flower cropped by maiden’s finger, be it of delicate</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">violet or drooping hyacinth, unforsaken as yet of its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sparkling hue and its graceful outline, though its parent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">earth no longer feeds it or supplies it with strength. Then <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brought forth Æneas two garments stiff with gold and purple,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which Dido had wrought for him in other days with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her own hands, delighting in the toil, and had streaked</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their webs with threads of gold. Of these the mourner</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spreads one over his youthful friend as a last honour, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and muffles the locks on which the flame must feed: moreover</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he piles in a heap many a spoil from Laurentum’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fray, and bids the plunder be carried in long procession.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The steeds too and weapons he adds of which he had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stripped the foe. Already had he bound the victims’ <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hands behind their backs, doomed as a sacrifice to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dead man’s spirit, soon to spill their blood over the fire:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and now he bids the leaders in person carry tree-trunks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clad with hostile arms, and has the name of an enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">attached to each. There is Acœtes led along, a lorn old <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man, marring now his breast with blows, now his face with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">laceration, and anon he throws himself at his full length</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the ground. They lead too the car, all spattered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with Rutulian blood. After it the warrior steed, Æthon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his trappings laid aside, moves weeping, and bathes his <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">visage with big round drops. Others carry the spear and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the helm: for the rest of the harness is Turnus’ prize.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then follows a mourning army, the Teucrians, and all the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tuscans, and the sons of Arcady with weapons turned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">downward. And now after all the retinue had passed on <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in long array, Æneas stayed, and groaning deeply uttered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one word more: “We are summoned hence by the same</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fearful destiny of war to shed other tears: I bid you hail</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">forever, mightiest Pallas, and forever farewell.” Saying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this and this only, he turned to the lofty walls again, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bent his footsteps campward.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now appeared the ambassadors from the town of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latium, with the coverings of their olive boughs, entreating <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an act of grace: the bodies which were lying over the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plains as the steel had mowed them down they pray him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to restore, and suffer them to pass under the mounded</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">earth: no man wars with the vanquished and with those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who have left the sun: let him show mercy to men once <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">known as his hosts and the fathers of his bride. The good</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas hearkens to a prayer that merits no rebuke, grants</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them the boon, and withal bespeaks them thus: “What</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">undeserved ill chance, men of Latium, has entangled you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in a war so terrible and made you fly from us your friends? <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ask you peace for the dead, for those on whom the War-god’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">die has fallen? Nay, I would fain grant it to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">living too. I were not here had not fate assigned me a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">portion and a home: nor wage I war against your nation:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it was the king that abandoned our alliance, and sought <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shelter rather under Turnus’ banner. Fairer it had been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that Turnus should have met the death-stroke ye mourn.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If he seeks to end the war by strength of arm and expel the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trojan enemy, duty bade him confront me with weapons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like mine, and that one should have lived who had earned <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">life from heaven or his own right hand. Now go and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kindle the flame beneath your ill-starred townsmen.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas’ speech was over: they stood in silent wonder, their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eyes and countenances steadfastly fixed on each other.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Drances, elder in birth, ever embroiled with the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">youthful Turnus by hatred and taunting word, thus speaks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in reply: “O mighty in fame’s voice, mightier in your own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brave deeds, hero of Troy, what praise shall I utter to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">match you with the stars? Shall I first admire your sacred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">love of right, or the toils of your hand in war? Ours it <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall be gratefully to report your answer to our native</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town, and should any favouring chance allow, make you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the friend of king Latinus. Let Turnus look for alliance</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">where he may. Nay, it will be our pride to uprear those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">massive walls of destiny, and heave on our shoulders the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stones of your new Troy.” He spoke, and the rest all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">murmured assent. For twelve days they make truce, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with amity to mediate, Trojans and Latians mingled roam <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the forest on the mountain slopes unharming and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unharmed. The lofty ash rings with the two-edged steel:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they bring low pines erst uplifted to the sky, nor is there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pause in cleaving with wedges the oak and fragrant cedar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or in carrying ashen trunks in the groaning wains. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now flying Fame, the harbinger of that cruel agony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is filling with her tidings the ears of Evander, his palace and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his city—Fame that but few hours back was proclaiming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallas the conqueror of Latium. Forth stream the Arcadians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the gates, with funeral torches in ancient fashion, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snatched up hurriedly; the road gleams with the long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">line of fire, which parts the breath of fields on either hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To meet them comes the train of Phrygians, and joins the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wailing company. Soon as the matrons saw them pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">under the shadow of the houses, they set the mourning city <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ablaze with their shrieks. But Evander—no force can</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hold him back; he rushes into the midst: there as they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lay down the bier he has flung himself upon Pallas, and is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clinging to him with tears and groans, till choking grief</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at last lets speech find her way: “No, my Pallas! this was <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not your promise to your sire, to trust yourself with caution</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the War-god’s savage hands. I knew what a spell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there lay in the young dawn of a soldier’s glory, the enrapturing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pride of the first day of battle. Alas for the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ill-starred first-fruits of youth, the cruel foretaste of the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coming war! alas for those my vows and prayers, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">found no audience with any of the gods! alas too for thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my blessed spouse, happy as thou art in the death that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spared thee not for this heavy sorrow! while I, living on,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have triumphed over my destiny, that I might survive in <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">solitary fatherhood. Had I but followed the friendly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">standards of Troy, and fallen whelmed by Rutulian javelins!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">had I rendered my own life up, so that this funeral</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">train should have borne <i>me</i> home, and not my Pallas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor yet would I blame you, men of Troy, nor the treaty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">we made, nor the hands we plighted in friendship; it is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but the portion ordained long ago as fitting for my gray</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hairs. If it was written that my son should die ere his <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">time, it shall be well that he fell after slaying his Volscian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thousands, while leading a Teucrian army to the gates of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latium. Nay, my Pallas, I would wish for you no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">worthier funeral than that accorded to you by Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the good and his noble Phrygians, by the Tyrrhene leaders, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the whole Tyrrhene host. Each bears you a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trophy whom your right hand sends down to death. And</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you, too, proud Turnus, would be standing at this moment,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a giant trunk hung round with armour, had your age been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but as his, the vigour of your years the same. But why <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should misery like mine hold back the Teucrians from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle? Go, and remember to bear my message to your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king. If I still drag the wheels of my hated life now my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallas is slain, it is because of your right hand, which owes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the debt of Turnus’ life to son and sire, yourself being witness. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">This is the one remaining niche for your valour and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your fortune to fill. I ask not for triumph to gild my life:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that thought were crime: I ask but for tidings that I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may bear to my son down in the spectral world.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime the Goddess of Dawn had lifted on high her <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kindly light for suffering mortality, recalling them to task</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and toil. Already father Æneas, already Tarchon, have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set up their funeral piles along the winding shore. Hither</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each man brings the body of friend or kinsman as the rites</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of his sires command; and as the murky flames are applied <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">below, darkness veils the heights of heaven in gloom.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thrice they ran their courses round the lighted pyres,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sheathed in shining armour; thrice they circled on their</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">of wailing. Sprinkled is the earth with their tears, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sprinkled is the harness. Upsoars to heaven at once the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">helms and shapely swords and bridle-reins and glowing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wheels; some bring in offering the things the dead men</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wore, their own shields and the weapons that sped so ill.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many carcases of oxen are sacrificed round the piles:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bristly swine and cattle harried from the country round are <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">made to bleed into the flame. Then along the whole line</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of coast they gaze on their burning friends, and keep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sentry over the half-quenched fire-bed, nor let themselves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be torn away till dewy night rolls round the sky with its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">garniture of blazing stars. <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With like zeal the ill-starred Latians in a different quarter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">set up countless piles; of the multitude of corpses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">some they bury in the earth, some they lift up and carry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">off to neighbour districts, and send them home to the city;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rest, a mighty mass of promiscuous carnage, they burn <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">uncounted and unhonoured; and thereon the plains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through their length and breadth gleam with the thickening</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rivalry of funeral fires. The third morrow had withdrawn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the chill shadows from the sky: the mourners were</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">levelling the piles of ashes and sweeping the mingled bones <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the hearths, and heaping over them mounds of earth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where the heat yet lingers. But within the walls, in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">city of Latium’s wealthy king, the wailing is preëminent,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and largest the portion of that long agony. Here are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mothers and their sons’ wretched brides, here are sisters’ <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bosoms racked with sorrow and love, and children orphaned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of their parents, calling down curses on the terrible</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war and on Turnus’ bridal rites; he, he himself, they cry,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should try the issue with arms and the cold steel, who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">claims for himself the Italian crown and the honours of <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sovereignty. Fell Drances casts his weight into the scale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and bears witness that Turnus alone is challenged by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foe, Turnus alone defied to combat. Against them many</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a judgment is ranged in various phrase on Turnus’ side,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the queen’s august name lends him its shadow; many <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an applauding voice upholds the warrior by help of the</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Amid all this ferment, when the blaze of popular turmoil</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">is at its height, see, as a crowning blow, comes back the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sorrowing embassy with tidings from Diomede’s mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town: the cost of all their labours has gained them nought:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gifts and gold and earnest prayers are alike in vain: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latians must look for arms elsewhere, or sue for peace <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the Trojan chief. King Latinus himself is crushed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to earth by the weight of agony. The wrath of the gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the fresh-made graves before his eyes, tell him plainly that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas is the man of destiny, borne on by heaven’s manifest</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">his lofty doors. They have mustered from all sides, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are streaming to the palace through the crowded streets.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the midst Latinus takes his seat, at once eldest in years</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and first in kingly state, with a brow that knows not joy. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hereupon he bids the envoys returned from the Ætolian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town to report the answers they bear, and bids them repeat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each point in order. Silence is proclaimed, and Venulus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">obeying the mandate, begins to speak:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Townsmen, we have looked on Diomede and his Argive <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">encampment: the journey is overpast, and every chance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">surmounted, and we have touched the hand by which the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the namesake of his ancestral people, in the land of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iapygian Garganus which his sword had won. Soon as <span class="linenum">25</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">a Libyan coast? Even the monarch<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> of Mycenæ, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leader of the great Grecian name, met death on his very</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">threshold at the hand of his atrocious spouse; Asia fell <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">before him, but the adulterer rose in her room. Cruel gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that would not have me restored to the hearth-fires of my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">home, to see once more the wife of my longing and my own</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fair Calydon! Nay, even my flight is dogged by portents</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of dreadful view; my comrades torn from me are winging <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the air and haunting the stream as birds—alas that the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the fate I had to look for even from that day when with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my frantic steel I assailed the flesh of immortals, and impiously <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wounded Venus’ sacred hand. Nay, nay, urge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me no longer to a war like this. Since Pergamus fell, my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fightings with Troy are ended; I have no thought, no joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the evils of the past. As for the gifts which you bring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me from your home, carry them rather to Æneas. I tell <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you, I have stood against the fury of his weapon, and joined</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand to hand with him in battle; trust one who knows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">how strong is his onset as he rises on the shield, how</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fierce the whirlwind of his hurtling lance. Had Ida’s</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">marched in his turn to the gates of Inachus, and the tears</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The envoys had scarcely finished when a diverse murmur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">runs along the quivering lips of the sons of Ausonia, as, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when rapid streams are checked by rocks in their course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">confused sounds rise from the imprisoned torrent, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">neighbouring banks reëcho with the babbling of the waves.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as their passions were allayed, and their chafed countenances</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">settled in calm, the monarch, first invoking <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heaven, begins from his lofty throne:</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“To have taken your judgment, Latians, ere this on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">state of the common-weal, would have been my pleasure,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and our truer interest, rather than summon a council at a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crisis like this, when the foe has sat down before our walls. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A grievous war, my countrymen, we are waging with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seed of heaven, a nation unsubdued, whom no battles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">overtire, nor even in defeat can they be made to drop the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword. For any hope ye have cherished in the alliance of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ætolian arms, resign it forever. Each is his own hope; <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and how slender is this ye may see for yourselves. As</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to all beside, with what utter ruin it is stricken is palpable</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the sight of your eyes, to the touch of your hands. I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">throw the blame on none: manly worth has done the utmost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it could: all the sinews of the realm have been strained <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the contest. Now then I will set forth what is the judgment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of my wavering mind, and show you it in few words,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">if ye will lend me your attention. There is an ancient</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">territory of mine bordering on the Tuscan river, extending</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lengthwise to the west, even beyond the Sicanian frontier; <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Auruncans and Rutulians are its tillers, subduing with the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">on the rugged slopes. Let this whole district, with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lofty mountain and its belt of pines, be our friendly gift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the Teucrians; let us name equal terms of alliance, and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">invite them to share our kingdom; let them settle here, if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their passion is so strong, and build them a city. But if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they have a mind to compass other lands and another</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">nation, and are free to quit our soil, let us build twenty ships</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Italian timber, or more if they have men to fill them:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there is the wood ready felled by the river side; let themselves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prescribe the size and the number; let us provide</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brass, and hands, and naval trim. Moreover, to convey <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our proffers and ratify the league, I would have an embassy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of a hundred Latians of the first rank sent with peaceful</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">branches in their hands, carrying also presents, gold and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ivory, each a talent’s weight, and the chair and striped</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">At these words Turnus’ violence blazed out: heaving a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">on without cease, throwing all into measureless panic,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heightening the prowess of a nation twice conquered already,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and dwarfing no less the arms of your king. See, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now the lords of the Myrmidons<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> are quaking at the martial</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and the rest, and river Aufidus is in full retreat from the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">points his charges with the sting of terror. Never, I</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">counsel. If you have no hope beyond in aught our arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">can do, if we are so wholly forlorn, destroyed root and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">branch by one reverse, and our star can never rise again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then pray we for peace and stretch craven hands in suppliance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, oh, had we but one spark of the worth that <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once was ours, that man I would esteem blest beyond</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">others in his service and princely of soul, who, sooner than</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">for all bitten the dust. But if we have still store of power,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a harvest of youth yet unreaped, if there are cities <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and nations of Italy yet to come to our aid, if the Trojans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as well as we have won their glory at much bloodshed’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cost—for they too have their deaths—the hurricane has</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">swept over all alike—why do we merely falter on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">threshold? why are we seized with shivering ere the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trumpet blows? Many a man’s weal has been restored</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by time and the changeful struggles of shifting days: many</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a man has Fortune, fair and foul by turns, made her sport <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and then once more placed on a rock. Grant that we shall</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">from Messapus, and the blest Tolumnius, and all the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaders that those many nations have sent us; nor small</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall be the glory which will wait on the flower of Latium <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Laurentine land. Ay, and we have Camilla,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the noble Volscian race, with a band of horsemen at her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back and troops gleaming with brass. If it is I alone that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Teucrians challenge to the fight, and such is your will,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and my life is indeed the standing obstacle to the good of <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all, Victory has not heretofore fled with such loathing from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my hands that I should refuse to make my venture for a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">have I here devoted this my life, I, Turnus, second in</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">away!”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So were these contending over matters of doubtful debate:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas was moving his army from camp to field.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">See, there runs a messenger from end to end of the palace</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">amid wild confusion, and fills the town with a mighty <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">terror, how that in marching array the Trojans and the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tuscan force are sweeping down from Tiber’s stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over all the plain. In an instant the minds of the people</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are confounded, their bosoms shaken to the core, their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">passions goaded by no gentle stings. They clutch at arms, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clamour for arms: arms are the young men’s cry: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weeping fathers moan and mutter. And now a mighty</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">din, blended of discordant voices, soars up to the skies,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">even as when haply flocks of birds have settled down in a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lofty grove, or on the fishy stream of Padusa hoarse swans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">make a noise along the babbling waters, “Ay, good citizens,”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cries Turnus, seizing on his moment, “assemble</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your council and sit praising peace; they are rushing on <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the realm sword in hand.” Without further speech he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dashed away and issued swiftly from the lofty gate.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“You, Volusus,” he cries, “bid the Volscian squadrons arm,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and lead out the Rutulians. You, Messapus, and you,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Coras<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and your brother, spread the horse in battle array <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the breadth of the plain. Let some guard the inlets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the city and man the towers; the rest attack with me in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the quarter for which I give the word.” At once there is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a rush to the ramparts from every part of the city: king</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latinus leaves the council and the high debate unfinished, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and wildered with the unhappy time, adjourns to another</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">day, ofttimes blaming himself that he welcomed not with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">open arms Æneas the Dardan, and bestowed on the city</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a husband for the daughter of Latium. Others dig</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trenches before the gates or shoulder stones and stakes. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The hoarse trumpet gives its deathful warning for battle.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The walls are hemmed by a motley ring of matrons and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">boys: the call of the last struggle rings in each one’s ear.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Moreover the queen among a vast train of Latian mothers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is drawn to the temple, even to Pallas’ tower on the height, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with presents in her hand, and at her side the maid Lavinia,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cause of this cruel woe, her beauteous eyes cast down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The matrons enter the temple and make it steam with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">incense, and pour from the august threshold their plaints</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of sorrow: “Lady of arms, mistress of the war, Tritonian<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">maiden, stretch forth thy hand and break the spear of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phrygian freebooter, lay him prostrate on the ground,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and leave him to grovel under our lofty portals.” Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with emulous fury arms himself for the battle. And now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he has donned his ruddy corslet, and is bristling with <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brazen scales; his calves have been sheathed in gold, his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temples yet bare, and his sword had been girded to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">side, and he shines as he runs all golden from the steep</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the citadel, bounding high with courage, and in hope</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">already forestalls the foe: even as when a horse, bursting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his tether, escapes from the stall, free at last and master</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the open champaign,<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> either wends where the herds of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mares pasture, or wont to bathe in the well-known river <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">darts forth and neighs with head tossed on high in wanton</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frolic, while his mane plays loosely about neck and shoulders.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His path Camilla crosses, a Volscian army at her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back, and dismounts from her horse at the gate with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queenly gesture; the whole band follow her lead, quit <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their horses, and alight to earth, while she bespeaks him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thus: “Turnus, if the brave may feel faith in themselves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I promise boldly to confront the cavalry of Troy and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">singly ride to meet the Tyrrhene horse. Let me essay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the first hazard of the combat; do you on foot remain by <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the walls and be the city’s guard.” Turnus replies, gazing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steadfastly on the dreadful maid: “O maiden, glory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Italy, what thanks shall I strive to speak or render?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but seeing that soul of yours soars above all, partake the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">toil with me. Æneas, as rumour and missioned spies tell <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me for truth, has cunningly sent on his light-armed cavalry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to scour the plain, while he, surmounting the lonely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steeps of the hill, is marching townward. I meditate a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stratagem of war in that woodland gorge, to beset the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">narrow thoroughfare with an armed band. Do you in <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle array receive the Tuscan horse. With you will</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be keen Messapus, and the Latian cavalry, and Tiburtus’</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">he exhorts Messapus and the federate leaders with like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">words to the fight, and advances to meet the enemy. <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A glen there is, narrow and winding, suited for ambush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and stratagems of arms, pent in on both sides by a mountain-wall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">black with dense foliage; a scant pathway leads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to it, with straitened gorge and jealous inlet. Above it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the mountain’s watch-tower height lies a concealed <span class="linenum">35</span></div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime, in the mansions above Latona’s daughter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was addressing Opis the swift, a maiden comrade of her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sacred train, and was uttering these words in tones of <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sorrow: “Ah, maiden, Camilla is on her way to the ruthless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war; in vain she girds herself with the arms of our</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sisterhood, dear to me that she is beyond all beside: for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no new tenderness this that has come on Diana, nor sudden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the spell wherewith it stirs her heart. When Metabus, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">exiled for the hate which tyranny genders, was parting</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from Privernum, his ancient city, as he fled from the heart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the combat, he bore away his infant child to share his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">banishment, and varying Casmilla, her mother’s name,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">called her Camilla. The father, carrying her in his bosom, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was making for the long mountain slopes of the solitary</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">woods, while bitter javelins were showering all around him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Volscians with circling soldiery hovering about:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when lo! intercepting his flight was Amasenus, brimming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and foaming over its banks, so vast a deluge of rain had <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">burst from the clouds. Preparing to plunge in, he is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">checked by tenderness for his child, and fears for the precious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">load. At last, as he pondered over every course,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he hit suddenly on this resolve. There was a huge weapon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which he chanced to be carrying in his stalwart hand <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as warriors use, sturdy with knots and seasoned timber:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to it he fastens his daughter, enclosed in the cork-tree’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forest bark, and binds her neatly round the middle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the shaft; then, poising it in a giant’s grasp, he thus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">exclaims to heaven: ‘Gracious lady, dweller in the woods, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latona’s maiden daughter, I vow to thy service this my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">child: thine are the first weapons that she wields as she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flies from the foe through air to thy protection. Receive,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I conjure thee, as thine own her whom I now entrust to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">uncertain gale.’ He said, and, drawing back his arm, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hurled the javelin: loud roared the waves, while over the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">furious stream fled poor Camilla on the hurtling dart.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Metabus, pressed closer and closer by the numerous</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">band, leaps into the river, and in triumph plucks from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grassy bank his offering to Trivia, the javelin and the maid.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No cities opened to him house or stronghold, for his wild</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nature had never brooked submission: among the shepherds’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lonely mountains he passed his days. There in the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">woods, among beasts’ savage lairs, he reared his daughter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on milk from the breast of an untamed mare, squeezing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the udder into her tender lips. And soon as the child</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">first stood on her feet, he armed her hands with a pointed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">javelin, and hung from her baby shoulder a quiver and a <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bow. For the golden brooch in her hair, for the long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sweeping mantle, there hang from her head adown her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back a tiger’s spoils. Even then she launched with tiny</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand her childish missiles, swung round her head the sling’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">well-turned thong, and brought down a crane from Strymon <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or a snow-white swan. Many a mother in Tyrrhene</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town has wooed her for her son in vain: with no thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but for Dian, she cherishes in unsullied purity her love for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hunter’s and the maiden’s life. Would she had never</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">been pressed for warfare like this, essaying to strike a blow <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the Teucrians: so had she still been my darling and a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sister of my train. But come, since cruel destiny is darkening</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round her, glide down, fair nymph, from the sky,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and repair to the Latian frontier, where now in an evil hour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the tearful battle is joining. Take these arms, and draw <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the quiver an avenging shaft: therewith let the foe,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whoever he be, Trojan or Italian, that shall profane with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the stroke of death that sacred person, make to me in like</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">manner the atonement of his blood. Afterwards in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hollow of a cloud I will bear off the body of my lost favourite <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">undespoiled of its arms, and lay her down in her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own land.” Thus she: and Opis hurtled downward through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the buoyant air, a black whirlwind enswathing her form.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the Trojan band meanwhile is nearing the walls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the Etruscan chiefs and the whole array of cavalry, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">marshalled into companies. Steeds are prancing and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">neighing the whole champaign over, and chafing against</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the drawn bridle as they face hither and thither: the field,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">all iron, bristles far and wide with spears, and the plains</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are ablaze with arms reared on high. Likewise Messapus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the other side and the swift-paced Latians, and Coras</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his brother, and maid Camilla’s force appear in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plain against them, couching the lance in their backdrawn <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hands and brandishing the javelin: and the onset of warriors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the neighing of steeds begin to wax hot. And</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now each army had halted within a spear-throw of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">other: with a sudden shout they dash forward, and put</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spurs to their fiery steeds: missiles are showered from all <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sides in a moment, thick as snow-flakes, and heaven is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">curtained with the shade. Instantly Tyrrhenus and fierce</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Aconteus charge each other spear in hand, and foremost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of all crash together with sound as of thunder, so that the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chest of either steed is burst against his fellow’s; Aconteus, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flung off like the levinbolt or a stone hurled from an engine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tumbles headlong in the distance, and scatters his life in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">air. At once the line of battle is broken, and the Latians,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turned to flight, sling their shields behind them and set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their horses’ heads cityward. The Trojans give them <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chase: Asilas in the van leads their bands. And now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they were nearing the gates, when the Latians in turn set</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up a shout, and turn their chargers’ limber necks; the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">others fly, and retreat far away at full speed. As when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sea, advancing with its tide that ebbs and flows, one <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">while sweeps towards the land, deluges the rocks with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shower of spray, and sprinkles the sandy margin with the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">contents of its bosom, one while flees in hasty retreat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dragging back into the gulf the recaptured stones, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with ebbing waters leaves the shore. Twice the Tuscans <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drove the Rutulians in rout to their walls; twice, repulsed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they look behind as they sling their shields backward.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when in the shock of a third encounter the entire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armies grapple each other, and man has singled out man,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then in truth upsoar the groans of the dying, and arms and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bodies and death-stricken horses blended with human</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage welter in pools of gore: and a savage combat is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aroused. Orsilochus hurls a spear at Remulus’ horse—for</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rider he feared to encounter—and leaves the steel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lodged under the ear. Maddened by the blow, the beast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rears erect, and, uplifting its breast, flings its legs on high</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in the uncontrolled agony of the wound: Remulus unseated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rolls on earth, Catillus dismounts Iollas, and likewise <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Herminius, giant in courage, and giant too in stature</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and girth: his bare head streams with yellow locks, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his shoulders also are bare: wounds have no terrors for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him, so vast the surface he offers to the weapon. Through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his broad shoulders comes the quivering spear, and bows <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the impaled hero double with anguish. Black streams</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of gore gush on all sides: the combatants spread slaughter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the steel, and rush on glorious death through a storm</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of wounds.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Camilla, with a quiver at her back, and one breast <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">put forth for the combat, leaps for joy like an Amazon in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the midst of carnage: now she scatters thick volleys of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quivering javelins, now her arm whirls unwearied the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">massy two-edged axe: while from her shoulder sounds the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">golden bow, the artillery of Dian. Nay, if ever she be <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beaten back and retreating rearward, she turns her bow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and aims shafts in her flight. Around her are her chosen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comrades, maid Larina, and Tulla, and Tarpeia, wielding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the brazen-helved hatchet, daughters of Italy, whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">glorious Camilla herself chose to be her joy and pride, able <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to deal alike with peace and war: even as the Amazons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Thrace when they thunder over the streams of Thermōdon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and battle with her blazoned arms, encompassing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hippolyte, or when Penthesilea, the War-god’s darling,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is careering to and fro in her chariot, and the woman <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">army, amid a hubbub of shrill cries, are leaping in ecstasy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and shaking their moony shields. Who first, who last,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fierce maiden, is unhorsed by your dart? How many stalwart</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bodies lay you low in death? The first was Eunēus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Clytius’ son, whose unguarded breast as he stood fronting <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her she pierces with her long pine-wood spear. Down he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goes, disgorging streams of blood, closes his teeth on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gory soil, and dying writhes upon his wound. Then</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Liris, and Pagasus on his body: while that, flung from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his stabbed charger, is gathering up the reins, and this is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coming to the rescue and stretching his unarmed hand to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his falling comrade, they are overthrown in one headlong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ruin. To these she adds Amastrus, son of Hippotas: <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">then, pressing on the rout, pursues with her spear-throw</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tereus, and Harpalycus, and Demophoon, and Chromis:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for every dart she launched from her maiden hand there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fell a Phrygian warrior. In the distance rides Ornytus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">accoutred strangely in hunter fashion on an Iapygian <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steed: a hide stripped from a bullock swathes his broad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shoulders in the combat, his head is sheltered by a wolf’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">huge grinning mouth and jaws with the white teeth projecting,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and a rustic pike arms his hand: he goes whirling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the ranks, his whole head overtopping them. <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Him she catches, an easy task when the hosts are entangled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in rout, pierces him through, and thus bespeaks the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fallen in the fierceness of her spirit: “Tuscan, you thought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yourself still chasing beasts in the forest, but the day is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">come which shall refute the vaunts of your nation by a <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">woman’s weapons. Yet no slight glory shall you carry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down to your fathers’ shades, that you have fallen by the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dart of Camilla.” Next follow Orsilochus and Butes, two</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the hugest frames of Troy: Butes she speared behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">’twixt corslet and helm, where the sitter’s neck is seen <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gleaming, and the shield is hanging from the left arm:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Orsilochus, as she pretends to fly and wheels round in a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty ring, she baffles by ever circling inwards, and chases</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him that chases her: at last, rising to the stroke, she brings</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down on the wretch again and again, spite of all his prayers, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her massy battle-axe that rives armour and bone: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brain spouts over the face through the ghastly wound.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now there stumbles upon her, and pauses in terror at the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sudden apparition, the warrior son of Aunus, dweller on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Apennine, not the meanest of Liguria’s children while <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fate prospered his trickery. He, when he sees no speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of flight can escape the combat, or avoid the onset of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dreadful queen, essaying to gain his base end by policy</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and stratagem, thus begins: “What great glory is it</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">after all, if you, a woman, trust your mettled steed? Put</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">away the chance of flight, and dare to meet me hand to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand on equal ground, and gird you for battle on foot:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soon shall you see which of us gains honour from this <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">windy boasting.” He said: but she, all on fire, stung with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bitter grief, gives her horse to her comrade, and stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ready to meet him in arms, fearless though on foot, with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">naked sword and maiden shield. But the youth, deeming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that his wiles had sped, darts away without more ado, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and turning his bridle, rides off in flight, and wearies his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beast with the strokes of his iron heel. “False Ligurian,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vainly puffed up with overweening fancies, to no end have</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you tried your sire’s slippery craft, nor shall your lying</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bring you safe to Aunus the liar.” So cries the maiden, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and with lightning-like pace crosses at full speed the horse’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">path, and seizing the reins, fronts and encounters him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and gluts her vengeance with his hated blood: easily as a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hawk, the bird of augury, darting from a lofty rock, comes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">up with a dove high in the clouds, holds her in his gripe, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and with crooked talons tears out her heart, while gore and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plucked feathers come tumbling from the sky.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But no blind spectator of the scene is sitting throned on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">high Olympus, even the father of men and gods. The sire</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">urges Tarchon the Tuscan to the ruthless fray, and goads <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him to wrath by no gentle stings. So among heaps of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carnage and yielding bands Tarchon goes riding, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rouses the cavalry with words of diverse purport, calling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each by his name, and gives the beaten new strength for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle. “What terror, O ye Tuscan hearts that will not <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">feel, that will still be sluggish, what strange cowardice has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">come on you? To what end is this steel, these idle weapons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our right hands bear? But slow ye are not to hear the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">call of love, or when the wry-necked fife gives the word for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Bacchic dance: ay, there is your passion, there your <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">delight, till the favouring seer announce the sacrificial</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">feast, and the fat victim invite you to the tall trees of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grove.” So saying, he spurs his steed into the midst,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">ready for the death he brings to others, and charges in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fury on Venulus, snatches the foe from his horse, folds his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arms round him, and carries him on his saddle before him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with wild and violent speed. Upsoars a shout to heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and every Latian eye is turned to the scene. Over the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plain like lightning flies Tarchon, bearing the warrior</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and his arms. Then from the top of the chiefs own spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he breaks off the point, and feels for an unguarded part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where to plant the deadly blow: the foe, struggling, keeps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">off Tarchon’s hand from his throat, and repels force with <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">force. As when the golden eagle soaring on high carries</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a serpent he has caught, trussing it in his claws, and adhering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with his taloned gripe; the wounded reptile writhes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its spiral coils, stiffens with erected scales, and hisses from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its mouth, surging and swelling; the eagle, undismayed, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plies it despite its struggles with his hooked beak, while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his pinions beat the air: even thus Tarchon carries his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prize in triumph from the bands of Tibur’s folk. Following</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their chief’s auspicious lead, the sons of Mæonia charge</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the foe. Then Arruns, the man of fate, compasses swift <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Camilla about, dart in hand, with many a forestalling wile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and tries what chance may be readiest. Wherever the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fiery maid dashes into the midst of the battle, Arruns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">threads his way after her, and scans her steps in silence:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wherever she returns in triumph, escaping safely from the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foe, that way the youth turns his swift and stealthy rein;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now makes proof of this approach, now of that, and traverses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the whole circle, and shakes with relentless malice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his inevitable lance. It chanced that one Chloreus, sacred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Cybele and once her priest, was shining conspicuous <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from afar in Phrygian armour, urging on a foaming charger,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whose covering was a skin adorned with golden clasp and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brazen scales set plume-wise. He, in the blaze of foreign</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">purple, was launching Gortynian shafts from a Lycian bow;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">golden was the bow that rang from his shoulder, golden the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">helm on his sacred head; his saffron scarf with its rustling</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gauzy folds was gathered up by a golden brooch, and his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tunic and his hose decked with barbaric broidery. He it</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">was that the maiden, eager, it may be, to fasten on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">temple-gate the arms of Troy, or to flaunt herself in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">golden spoil, singled out from all the battle, and was following</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a hunter’s blind devotion, raging recklessly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the ranks, enkindled with a woman’s love for prey <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and plunder; when at length, seizing his opportunity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arruns awakes his dart from its ambush, and thus prays</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aloud to heaven: “Greatest of gods, Apollo, guardian of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">divine Soracte, whom we are the first to worship, for whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the pine-tree glow is fed by heaps of wood, while ourselves, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thy votaries, strong in our piety, walk through the flame</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over living embers, grant, all-powerful sire, that my arms</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may wipe this scandal away. I seek no plunder or spoil,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">no trophy for the conquest of a maid; the rest of my deeds</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall secure my fame; let but this terrible fiend fall vanquished <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by wound of mine, I will return to the cities of my</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fathers an unhonoured man.” Phœbus heard, and vouchsafed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in his heart that half the vow should speed, while</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">half he scattered among the flying breezes: to strike and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slay Camilla with sudden death-wound, so much he grants <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the suppliant: to return and meet the eyes of his noble</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fatherland, this he allows not; the gusts of air turned the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">accents into wind. So when the spear, launched from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand, was heard along the sky, each keen Volscian mind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flew to one centre, every Volscian eye was bent on the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">queen. She alone had no thought for wind or sound or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapon sweeping down from heaven, till the spear had</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">made its passage and lodged beneath her protruded breast,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and deeply driven, drank her maiden blood. Her comrades</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">run together in alarm, and support their falling mistress. <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Arruns, more terrified than all, flies away, half joy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">half fear, nor puts further confidence in his lance, nor dares</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to meet the darts of the maiden. Even as the caitiff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wolf, ere the weapons of vengeance can follow him, has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fled at once to the pathless privacy of the mountain steep, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on slaying a shepherd or mighty bullock, conscious of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">daring deed, and drawing back his quivering tail with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lithe action has clapped it to his belly and made for the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">woods, in like manner Arruns all wildered has stolen away</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from sight, and contented to escape has plunged into the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thick of the battle. With dying hand the maiden pulls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the spear; but the steely point stands lodged among the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bones at the ribs in the deep wound it made. Drained of <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blood, she sinks to earth; sink, too, her death-chilled eyes;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her once bright bloom has left her face. Then at her last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gasp she accosts Acca, one of her maiden train, who beyond</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the rest was Camilla’s friend and shared her thoughts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and speaks on this wise; “Thus far, sister Acca, has <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strength been given me: now the cruel wound overcomes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me; and all around me grows dim and dark. Haste and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">carry Turnus my dying charge, to take my place in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle and keep off the Trojans from the town. And now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">farewell.” As she spoke she dropped the bridle, swimming <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down to earth with no willing act. Then as the death-chill</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grows she gradually discumbers herself of the entire weight</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the body, droops her unstrung neck and her head on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which fate has seized, quitting too her armour, and her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soul, resenting its lot, flies groaningly to the shades. Then <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">indeed, rising unmeasured, the uproar strikes the golden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stars: Camilla overthrown, the fight waxes fiercer: on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they rush thickening, at once the whole force of the Teucrians,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Tyrrhene leaders, and Evander’s Arcad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cavalry. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Trivia’s sentinel Opis has long been seated high on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the mountain top, an undismayed spectator of the combat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And when far off, deep among the din of raging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">warriors, she spied Camilla shent by ruthless death, she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaned, and fetched these words from the bottom of her <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breast: “Poor maiden! too, too cruel the penalty you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have paid for provoking the Teucrians to battle. Nought</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has it bestead you at your need to have served Dian in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forest, and carried on your shoulder the shafts of our sisterhood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet not unhonoured has your queen left you even <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">here in death’s extremity; nor shall this your end be without</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its glory in the world, nor yourself bear the ignominy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the unrevenged; for he, whoever he be, whose wound</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">has profaned your person, shall atone it by the death he</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">has earned.” Under the lofty mountain’s shade there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stood a vast mound of earth, the tomb of Dercennus, an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">old Laurentine king, shrouded with dark ilex: here the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beauteous goddess first alights with a rapid bound, and <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spies out Arruns from the barrow’s height. Soon as she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">saw him gleaming in his armour, and swelling with vanity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why stray from the path?” cries she; “turn your feet</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hitherward! come hither to your death, and receive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Camilla’s guerdon! Alack! and are you too to be slain <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the shafts of Dian?” She said, and with the skill of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thracian maiden drew a swift arrow from her gilded quiver,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bent the bow with deadly aim, and drew it far apart, till</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the arching ends met together, and with her two hands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she touched, the barb of steel with her left, her breast with <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her right and the bowstring. Forthwith the hurtling of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the shaft and the rush of the breeze reached Arruns’ ear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at the moment the steel lodged in his body. Him gasping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and groaning his last his comrades leave unthinking in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unmarked dust of the plain: Opis spreads her wings, and <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">is borne to skyey Olympus.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">First flies, its mistress lost, Camilla’s light-armed company;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fly the Rutules in rout, flies keen Atinas; leaders</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in disarray and troops in devastation make for shelter,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turn round, and gallop to the walls. None can sustain <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in combat the Teucrians’ deadly onset or resist the stream;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">they throw their unstrung bows on their unnerved</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shoulders, and the hoof of four-foot steeds shakes the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crumbling plain. On rolls to the ramparts a cloud of dust,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thick and murky; and the matrons from their sentry-posts, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">smiting on their breasts, raise a shriek as women</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wont to the stars of heaven. Who first pour at speed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the open gates are whelmed by a multitude of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foemen that blends its crowd with theirs; they scape not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the agony of death, but on the very threshold, with their <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">native walls around them, in the sanctuary of home, they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">breathe away their lives. Some close the gates: they dare</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not give ingress to their friends nor take them within the</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">walls, implore as they may: and a piteous carnage ensues,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">these guarding the approach sword in hand, those rushing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the sword’s point. Some, borne on by the deluge,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stream headlong into the moat; some in blind agony,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spurring their horses, charge as with battering-rams the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">portals and their stubborn barriers. Nay, the very matrons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the walls in the intensity of the struggle, prompted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by true patriot spirit at sight of Camilla, fling darts from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their quivering hands, and make hard oak-stakes and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seared truncheons do the work of steel, hot and headlong, <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and fain would be the first to die for their city.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime the cruel news floods Turnus’ ears in his forest-ambush,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as Acca tells the warrior her tale of mighty terror:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Volscian ranks destroyed, Camilla slain, the enemy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">coming on like a torrent, sweeping all before their victorious <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">onslaught, the alarm already wafted to the walls.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, all on fire (for even such is Jove’s stern requirement),</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quits his post on the hills, leaves the impregnable forest.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce had he passed from their sight and occupied the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plain, when father Æneas, entering the unguarded pass, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scales the hill-top, and issues through the shadowy wood.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So the two rivals march cityward at full speed, each with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all his army, nor long is the intervening distance; at the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">same moment Æneas looked far over the plains all smoking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with dust, and saw the host of Laurentum, and Turnus was <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">aware of fell Æneas in battle array, and heard the onward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tramp of feet and the neighing of steeds. Instantly they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were for closing in fight and throwing for the stake of combat;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but the time was come for reddening Phœbus to bathe</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his wearied team in the Hiberian flood, and bring back <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">night on the steps of retreating day. So they encamp</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">before the city, and make their ramparts strong.</div>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">When Turnus sees that the War-god’s enmity has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">broken the spirit of Latium, that men are beginning to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">claim his promise, and make him the mark of their eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he bursts at once into fury unappeasable, and swells his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pride to the height. As in Punic land, when the hunters <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">have wounded him deep in the breast, the lion at last rouses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself to fight, tosses with fierce joy his mane from his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">neck, snaps fearlessly the brigand’s spear in the wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and roars from his gory mouth: even so, Turnus once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kindled, his vehemence grows each moment. Then he <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">addresses the king, and dashes hotly into speech: “Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stops not the way: Æneas and his cowards have no plea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for retracting their challenge or disowning their plighted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">word; I meet the combat; bring the sacred things, good</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">father, and solemnize the truce. Either will I with my own <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">right hand send the Dardan down to Tartarus, the runaway</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from Asia—let the Latians sit by and see—and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with my single weapon refute the slander of a nation; or</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">With calm dignity of soul the king makes answer:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Gallant youth, the greater your impetuous valour, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more watchful must needs be my foresight, the more</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">your father Daunus’ kingdom, you have many a town <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">won by your own sword: I that speak have gold and a</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Fate to give my daughter to any of her early suitors;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so sang gods and men alike. Conquered by my love for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you, conquered by the ties of kindred and the sorrow of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my weeping queen, I set all pledges at naught, I snatched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bride from her plighted husband. I drew the unhallowed <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword. From that fatal day you see what troubles,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what wars are let loose upon me; you know the weight of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the sufferings which <i>you</i> are the first to feel. Twice vanquished</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in a mighty conflict, we scarce protect by our bulwarks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the hopes of Italy: Tiber’s waters are yet steaming <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with our blood, and the spacious plains are whitened by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our bones. Whither am I drifting again and again?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">what madness turns my brain? If on the death of Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I am ready to welcome these new allies, why should I not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">end the strife while he lives and is safe? What will our <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulian kinsmen say, what the rest of Italy, if—may</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune forefend the omen!—I give you up to death,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">These words abate not Turnus’ vehemence a whit: it</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as he can find utterance, he thus begins: “The care</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">My hand, too, can scatter darts and fling steel with no</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">his goddess-mother within call, to hide her craven son in an</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the queen, appalled by the new hazard of the combat,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">was all in tears, clinging to her fiery son-in-law with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the convulsive grasp of death: “Turnus, by these my</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">As Lavinia heard her mother’s voice, her glowing cheeks <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were bathed in tears; a deep blush kindled a fire, and shot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over her flushing face. As when a man has stained Indian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ivory with blood-red purple, or like a bed of lilies and roses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mixed: such hues were seen on the maiden’s countenance.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He, bewildered with passion, fixes his eyes upon her: the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sight makes him burn the more for battle, and thus he</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Lavinia’s hand be sought and won in yonder field.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So he spoke, and rushed back within doors: he calls for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his steeds, and joys to look on them snorting and neighing—the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steeds which Orithyia gave as a present to Pilumnus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to surpass the snows in whiteness, the winds in speed. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Round them stand the bustling charioteers, patting their</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Next he throws round his shoulders his hauberk, stiff</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with scales of gold and dazzling orichalc,<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> and adjusts to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his wear the sword, the shield, and the cones of the crimson <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crest—that sword the Fire-god’s own hand had made for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his father Daunus, and tempered it glowing in the Stygian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wave. Lastly, the spear which was standing in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">palace-hall, propped by a mighty column, the spoil of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Auruncan Actor, he seizes forcefully, sturdy as it is, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and shakes till it quivers, crying aloud: “Now, my good</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">myrrh.” So he rages, fury-driven: sparks flash from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">furnace of his countenance, lightnings dart from his <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fiery eyes; as when a bull in view of a fight raises fearful</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Then he calms his comrades’ fear and the grief of Iulus,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">looking in prospect on the plain, the two armies,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Trojan and Laurentine, and the Latian town. At once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">she addressed Turnus’ sister, a goddess herself, who presides</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Jove, the king of heaven, solemnly made hers in return for <span class="linenum">5</span></div>

    <div class="verse indent0">which I am not to blame. So long as Fortune seemed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and the day of doom and the power of the enemy are at <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand. I cannot look on the combat, nor on the league</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that ushers it in. If you have the nerve to dare aught for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your brother, go on; it is a sister’s part: perhaps the downtrodden</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">ended Juturna’s tears sprang forth, and thrice and again <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her hand smote on her lovely breast. “No time for tears,”</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meantime the monarchs appear, the stately form of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latian king riding in a four-horse car, his brows gleaming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with a circle of twelve gilded rays, the cognizance of the Sun</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his grandsire: Turnus is drawn by a snow-white pair, two <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spears with broad iron points quivering in his hands. Then</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comes father Æneas, the parent stock of the Roman tree,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">has brought the young of a bristly boar and an unclipped</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">offer the salted barley, score with the steel the brows of the</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">thus prays good Æneas, his sword drawn in his hand:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let the Sun above and the Earth beneath witness my invocation, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">this very Earth for which I have had the heart</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and Rivers I invoke, all the majesty of the sky, all the <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deities of the purple deep: if chance award the victory</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to Turnus the Ausonian, reason claims that the vanquished</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall retire to Evander’s town: Iulus shall quit the land,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nor shall Æneas’ children in after-days draw the sword again,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or threaten this realm with war. But should conquest <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">vouchsafe to us the smiles of the battle-field, as I rather</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deem, and pray that Heaven will rather grant, I will not bid</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Italians be subject to Troy, nor ask I the crown for</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">myself: no, let the two great nations, one unconquered as</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">The gods and their ritual shall be my gift: let my good</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">empire: the Teucrians shall raise me a city, and Lavinia</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall give it her name.” Thus first Æneas: the Latian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king follows, with eyes lifted to heaven, and right hand <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stretched to the stars: “I swear as you swore, Æneas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by Land and Ocean and Lights above, Latona’s twofold</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">offspring, and two-faced Janus, the potency of the gods</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Father too give ear, who ratifies covenants with thunder. <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My hand is on the altars; I adjure the fires and powers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that part us: so far as rests with Italy, no length of time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall break this bond of friendship, let things issue as they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">may: no violence shall make me swerve in will, not though</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deluge and chaos come again, ruining the earth into the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">water and crushing down heaven into Tartarus: even</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as this sceptre”—for a sceptre chanced to be in his hand—“shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">never more burgeon with light foliage into branch</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">or shade, now that once cut down in the woods it is orphaned</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of that which gave it life, and has resigned to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">axe its leaves and its sprays—once a tree, now the workman’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand has cased it with seemly brass, and given it to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">be wielded by Latium’s elders.” With words like these <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were they ratifying the treaty, all the nobles looking on.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then, as the rite ordains, they cut the throats of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hallowed’ victims into the fire, flay the yet breathing flesh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and pile the altars with laden chargers.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But the Rutulians have long been thinking the combat <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unequal: their bosoms are swayed by rival emotions,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all the more, the nearer they observe the ill-matched</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">champions. Turnus aids the feeling by the quietness of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his step and the downcast reverential look which he turns</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the altar, his wan cheeks, and the pallor of his youthful <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame. Soon as his sister Juturna heard such whispers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spreading, and saw the hearts of the multitude wavering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to and fro, she plunges among the ranks, taking the form</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Camers, great in ancestral dignity, great in the name of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his father’s worth, and himself a valiant warrior—plunges <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among the ranks, knowing well what she would have, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">scatters her sayings abroad in words like these: “Blush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ye not, Rutulians, with souls such as yours, to make one a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sacrifice for all? are we not equal to our foes in strength or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in numbers? See, here is their whole army, Trojan <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Arcadian, aye, and that fated band of Eturia, which</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seeks Turnus’ life. Though but half of us should engage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">each would scarce have an enemy to fight with. He, no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">doubt, will rise on the wings of fame to the gods for whose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">altars he gives himself to die, and will live in the mouths <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of men: we, stripped of our country, shall be the slaves of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">haughty masters, we, I say, now seated passively on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ground.” By such words the flame is fanned more and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more in those young warrior hearts, and murmurs run</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from rank to rank: not Rutulian alone, but Laurentian and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latian are changed men. They who a short while since</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">were hoping for their own repose and their state’s prosperity,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now burn for arms, would have the treaty undone,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and pity Turnus’ cruel fate. And now Juturna gives them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">one thing more, even a sign from heaven, no spell so potent</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to work on Italian minds and make them dupes of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">marvel. Flying through the ruddy sky, Jove’s golden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bird was chasing the river fowl, a winged noisy multitude, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when suddenly swooping on the water he carries off in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his tyrant claws a stately swan. The Italians are all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">attention, when lo! the whole mass of birds face about with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a scream, marvellous to see, their wings darkening the air,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and in dense cloud press on their enemy, till overborne by <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sheer weight he gives way, drops the booty from his talons</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into the river, flying aloft, and vanishes in the distant sky.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Oh, then the Rutulians welcome the omen with a shout and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spread their hands on high; and first of all cries the augur</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tolumnius. “Here, here is the thing I have prayed for so <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">often. I embrace it, I own the hand of Heaven. Follow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">me—yes, me—and seize your weapons, my poor countrymen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whom the felon stranger is scaring with battle, as if</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ye were feeble birds, and ravaging your coasts. He too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will turn to flight and sail far away on the deep. Close <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your ranks with one accord, and rally round the prince</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of whom the battle robs you.” He spoke, and running forward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hurls his dart full at the enemy: the hurtling cornel</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sounds, and cuts the air on no doubtful errand. A deafening</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shout follows on the act, the ranks are confused, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and men’s hearts stirred with mad bewilderment. On flew</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the spear, just where nine goodly brethren chanced to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stand facing it, all born of one true Tuscan mother to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Gylippus the Arcadian. One of these just at the waist</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where the quilted belt chafes against the belly and the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">buckle presses the sides—a youth of goodly form and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clad in refulgent armour—it strikes through the ribs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and lays him grovelling on the yellow sand. But his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brothers, a gallant company and stung by grief, draw their</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swords or seize their javelins, and charge in headlong fury. <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To meet them rush the Laurentian columns: while from</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Arcadians with inlaid harness. All are possessed by one</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">passion, to try the issue with the steel. The altars are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stripped bare: through the whole sky drives a flickering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">storm of weapons and an iron sleet comes thick: bowls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and hearths are carried away. King Latinus flies, bearing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">away his gods in discomfiture, the truce unratified. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Others rein the chariot or vault on horseback, with swords</div>

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Messapus, all on fire to annul the treaty, spurs his horse</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">in piteous sort with the altars that meet him behind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">falling on them head and shoulders. Up flashes Messapus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear in hand, and towering on horseback brings down on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him the massy beam in the midst of his prayers, and delivers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself thus: “He is sped: here is a better victim for the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty gods.” The Italians cluster round, and strip the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yet warm body. As Ebusus comes up and aims a blow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Corynæus meets him with a brand half-burnt from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">altar and dashes the fire in his face: his long beard burst</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">into a blaze and made a smell of burning hair: the enemy <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presses on, grasps in his left hand the locks of the wildered</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man and with the impact of his knee pins him to earth;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">naked sword: he, swinging back his axe, splits full in front</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the foe’s forehead and chin, and splashes his arms right</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and left with the blood. The heavy rest of iron slumber</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Soon as Turnus sees Æneas retiring from the battle,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the Trojan leaders in confusion, he glows with swift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">access of hope, calls for horses and armour, bounds like a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conqueror into the chariot, and takes the reins in hand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Many a heroic frame he slaughters as he whirls along, many <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he tumbles and leaves to live or die, crushes whole ranks</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the onset of his car, or plucks forth spears and hurls</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">them at the fliers. Just as storming along by Hebrus’ icy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flood gore-stained Mars smites on his shield, and stirring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">battle lets loose his fiery steeds: they fly over the plains <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">faster than winds southern or western: Thrace groans to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her extremity under the beat of their hoofs: around him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">circle the frowns of black-visaged Terror, and the powers</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Wrath and Treachery, liege followers of the god: with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">like eagerness through the thickest of the battle Turnus <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whirls his straining horses, trampling in piteous sort on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">slaughtered foe: the flying hoof spirts gory dew, and blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and sand are kneaded in a mass. Sthenelus he has slain</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">already, and Thamyris and Pholus, these hand to hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that from a distance: a distant death, too, has found the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imbrasidæ, Glaucus and Lades, trained in Lycia by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imbrasus their sire, and by him harnessed alike, warriors</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who could stand and fight or outride the winds. In another</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">part of the field Eumedes is riding through the fray, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gallant son of ancient Dolon, with the name of his grandsire, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the heart and hand of his sire, who of old, offering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to spy out the Danaan camp, dared to ask Achilles’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chariot as his guerdon; far other guerdon was it with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">which Diomed requited his daring, and his hopes are set on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Achilles’ steeds no longer. Marking him at distance along <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the plain, Turnus first sends after him a flying spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the intervening space, then stops the car and dismounts,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">comes on the wretch gasping and laid low, and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">setting his foot on his neck, wrests the sword from his hand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bathes it flashing deep in his throat, and thus accompanies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the blow: “Lie there, Trojan, and measure the Hesperian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soil you came to invade: such are their guerdons who</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">draw their swords on me; so build they up their city.” <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then with a spear throw he sends Asbutes to join the dead.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chloreus and Sybaris and Dares and Thersilochus, Thymœtes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">too, thrown off by a restiff horse. As when the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blast of Thracian Boreas roars on the deep Ægean and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drives the billows to the shore, wherever the winds push <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on, the clouds scurry over the sky, so when Turnus cleaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his path, the ranks give way, the armies turn in rout; the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">motion bears him along, and the gale which blows on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">car tosses his flickering crest. Phegeus, indignant at his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">overweening onset, meets the car and grasping the bridle <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrenches aside the foaming jaws of the impetuous steeds.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">While he is dragged along clinging to the yoke, the broad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spear-head reaches his unguarded breast, cleaves the two-plated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">corslet, and tastes the surface of the flesh. Yet he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his shield before him, kept fronting and threatening the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foe, and protecting himself with his drawn sword, when</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the wheel careering onward strikes and flings him on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ground, and Turnus with a sweep of his blade between</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the bottom of the helmet and the breastplate’s topmost</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rim has lopped the head and left the trunk to welter. <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">While Turnus thus is dealing havoc over the field,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Mnestheus, true Achates, and Ascanius have helped Æneas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the camp, all bleeding, and staying his halting steps</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the help of a spear. There he frets and struggles to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pull out the broken shaft, and calls for help the readiest <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">way, bidding them enlarge the wound with a broad sword,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cut the weapon’s lodgment to the bottom, and send him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to combat again. And now at his side was Iapis, son of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iasus, dearest of mankind to Phœbus, he to whom the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">god in his passionate fondness would fain have given his <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own function, his own hand’s cunning, the augur’s insight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the lyre, the weapons of archery; but he, wishing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to lengthen out the span of his bed-rid sire, chose rather</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">to know the virtue of simples and the laws of the healing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">art, and to practise in silence an unambitious craft.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There stood Æneas, fretting impatiently, propped on his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">massy spear, with a warrior concourse about him, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Iulus all in tears, yet himself unmoved by their sorrow. <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The aged leech, his garments swathed round him in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pæon’s fashion, is plying busily the healing hand and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Phœbus’ sovereign remedies all to no end, all to no end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">pulling at the dart and griping the steel with the pincer.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No Fortune guides the course of skill, no patron Phœbus <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lends his aid; and meanwhile the fierce alarms of the field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grow louder and louder, and the mischief is nearer at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand. They see dust-clouds propping the sky, the horsemen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gallop in, darts fall thick in the midst of the camp,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and heavenward mounts the cruel din of warriors battling <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or falling in the stern affray:—when, lo! Venus, struck</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to the heart by her son’s undeserved suffering, with a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mother’s care plucks dittany<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> from Cretan Ida, a plant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with downy leaves and a purple flower: wild goats know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that simple well, if the flying arrow should lodge in their <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flesh. Veiled by a dim cloud, the goddess brings it down;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with it she impregnates the spring water gleaming in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">caldron, imparting unseen powers, and sprinkles ambrosia’s<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">healthful juice and fragrant panacea. The old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">man rinsed the wound with the water so transformed, all <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unwitting, and in a moment all pain was fled from the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame, and the blood was stanched in the wound. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">arrow obeys the hand, and falls unforced, and strength is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">restored as before. “Quick! give the warrior his arms!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">why so tardy?” cries Iapis, himself the first to stir up <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the martial spirit. “No human aid has done this, no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">power of leech-craft; it is not my hand, Æneas, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">restores you; a mightier power than man’s is at work,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sending you back to mightier deeds.” The chief, greedy</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for the fight, has cased his legs in gold, chafing at delay <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and brandishing his spear. Soon as the shield is fitted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to his side, the cuirass to his back, he clasps Ascanius to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his mailed breast, and kissing his lips through the helmet</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">addresses him thus: “Learn valour from me, my son,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and genuine hardihood, success from others. To-day it is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my hand that shall shield you in war and lead you through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the walks of honour; be it your care, when your age has</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ripened into manhood, to bear the past in mind, seek <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">patterns among those of your own blood, and be stirred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to action by Æneas your sire and Hector your uncle.”</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">So having said, he passed towering through the gate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a huge spear quivering in his hand: Antheus and Mnestheus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">close their ranks and rush forth, and the whole <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">multitude streams from the empty camp. The field is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">clouded by blinding dust, and earth throbs and shudders</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the tramp of feet. Turnus saw them coming towards</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him from their battlements, the Ausonians saw, and a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cold shudder ran through their vitals: first before all the <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latians Juturna heard and knew the sound and shrank</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back in terror. As a storm-cloud bursting through the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sky sweeps down to earth along the main: hapless husbandmen</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">know it ere it comes, and shudder at heart;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">yes, it will bring havoc to their trees, devastation to their <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">crops, will lay all low far and wide; the winds fly before</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it and waft the sound to the shore: with as strong a rush</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Rhœteian chief sweeps his army full on the foe; they</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">close in firm masses and form severally at his side. Thymbræus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sword cuts down mighty Osiris, Mnestheus slays <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Archetius, Achates Epulo, and Gyas Ufens; falls too the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">augur Tolumnius, the first to fling his javelin at the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enemy. The din mounts to the sky, and the Rutulians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">routed in turn fly through the plains in a whirlwind of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dust. The hero himself neither stoops to slaughter the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flying nor encounter such as would fain meet him foot to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foot, weapon in hand: Turnus alone he tracks winding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the thick darkness, him alone he challenges to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">combat. The terror struck Juturna’s manly mind: she</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plucks from his seat Metiscus, Turnus’ charioteer, as he <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">drives the horses, and leaves him fallen at distance behind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the car: herself takes his place and handles the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flowing rein, assuming all that Metiscus had, voice and</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">person and armour. Like a black swallow that flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the house of some wealthy man and traverses</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the lofty hail, in quest of scraps of food for her twittering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nestlings; now she is heard in the empty cloisters, now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">about the watertanks; so drives Juturna through the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thick of the foe, and flies on rapid wheel from spot to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spot, now here, now there she gives a glimpse of her victorious</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">brother, yet never lets him stop and fight, but</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whirls far away in the distance. Æneas for his part</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">winds through sinuous paths in hope to meet him, tracks <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his steps, and shouts to him aloud across the weltering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ranks. Oft as he spies out the foe and tries by running</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to match the horses’ winged speed, each time Juturna</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wheels the car aside. What can he do? he tosses in aimless</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ebb and flow, thoughts distracting his mind this <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">way and that:—when lo! Messapus, with sudden movement,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">happening to carry two limber spear-shafts tipped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with steel, levels one at him and flings it true to its mark.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas stopped and gathered his arms about him, sinking</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on his knee; yet the fierce spear took the top of the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">helmet and struck the crest from the cone. Then at last</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his wrath mounts high; and under the duresse of treachery,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he sees the steeds and chariot whirling away from him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">after many an appeal to Jove and the altars of the violated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">league, he falls on the ranks before him, and fanned <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to dreadful vengeance by the War-god’s breath, lets loose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a carnage cruel and unsparing, and flings the reins on the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">neck of his passion.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now what god will tell me all those horrors and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">relate for me in verse the several scenes of slaughter, the <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deaths of the leaders whom Turnus here, the Trojan hero</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">there, is chasing over the plain? Was it thy will, great</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jove, that nations destined in time to come to everlasting</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">confronted by Rutulian Sucro<a href="#Footnote_o" class="fnanchor">[o]</a> (that combat first brought <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Trojan onset to a stand) after brief delay catches him</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">on the side and drives his stubborn sword death’s nearest</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">way through the ribs that fence the bosom. Turnus in</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">foot-encounter slays Amycus, whose horse had thrown</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him, and his brother Diores, striking one with the spear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ere he came up, the other with the swordblade, lops the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">heads of both, hangs them from his car, and carries them</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dripping with blood. That sends down Talos to death <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and Tanais and brave Cethegus, those at one onslaught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and hapless Onytes, of the house of Echion, brought forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by Peridia: that kills the brethren who came from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollo’s land of Lycia, and young Menœtes the Arcadian,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">who shrunk from war in vain; he plied his craft and lived <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in poverty by the fishy waters of Lerna, a stranger to the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">halls of the great; and his father tilled land for hire.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like two fires launched from different quarters on a dry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forest with bushes of crackling bay, or as when two foaming</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rivers pouring from lofty heights crash along and run <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">towards the ocean, each ploughing his own wild channel:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with no less fury rush through the fight Æneas and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus both: now, now the wrath is boiling within them:</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the whirl and the blow of a mighty rock dashes Murranus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">headlong from his car to the ground, Murranus who had</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">and a lineage stretching through the series of Latium’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">kings: the wheels throw forward the fallen man under the <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reins and yoke, and he is crushed by the quick hoof-beat</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of the steeds that mind not their lord. That meets</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hyllus as he rushed on in vehement fury, and hurls a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">javelin at his gold-bound brows: the spear pierced the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">helmet and stood fixed in the brain. Nor did your <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prowess, Cretheus, bravest of Greeks, deliver you from</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus, nor did the gods Cupencus worshipped shield</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">him from the onset of Æneas: his bosom met the steel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the check of the brazen buckler stood the wretch in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">small stead. You, too, great Æolus, the Laurentian <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plains looked on in death, spreading your frame abroad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over their surface: fallen are you, whom the Argive bands</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Priam’s realm: here was your fatal goal: a princely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">home under Ida’s shade: at Lyrnesus a princely hope, in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Laurentian soil a sepulchre. The two armies are in hot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conflict: all the Latians, all the sons of Dardanus, Mnestheus, <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and keen Serestus, and Messapus tamer of the steed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and brave Asilas, the Tuscan band, and Evander’s Arcad</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">cavalry, each man for himself straining every nerve: no</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stint, no stay; they strive with giant tension.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And now Æneas had a thought inspired by his beauteous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mother, to march to the walls, throw his force <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rapidly on the town, and stun the Latians with a sudden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">blow. Tracking Turnus through the ranks he swept his</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">respite from all that furious war, and lying in unchallenged</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">repose. At once his mind is fired with the vision of a <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">grander battle: Mnestheus he summons and Sergestus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and brave Serestus, the first in command, and mounts an</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eminence round which the rest of the Teucrian army</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">gathers in close ranks, not laying shield or dart aside.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Standing on the tall mound, he thus bespeaks them: <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let nothing stay my orders; the hand of Jove is here;</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">themselves vanquished, I will overthrow this day, and lay <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its smoking turrets level with the ground. What? am I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to wait till Turnus choose to bide the combat, and once</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conquered, meet me a second time? This, my men, is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the well-spring, this the head and front of the monstrous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war. Bring torches with speed, and reclaim the treaty <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fire in hand.” He said, and all with emulous spirit of</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">gates and slay those stationed there: some hurl the steel <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and overshadow the sky with javelins. Æneas himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">among the foremost lifts up his hand under the city wall,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">loudly upbraids the king, and calls the gods to witness</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">that he is once more forced into battle, the Italians twice</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his foes, the second treaty broken like the first. Strife</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet another stroke fell on Latium’s wearied sons,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shaking with its agony the city to her foundations. When <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the queen from her palace saw the enemy draw near, the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">walls assailed, flames flying roofward, the Rutulian army,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the soldiers of Turnus nowhere in sight, she deemed, poor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wretch, her warrior slain in the combat, and maddened</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with the access of grief, cries aloud that she alone is the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">guilty cause, the fountainhead of all this evil; and flinging</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">out wild words in the fury of her frenzied anguish,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rends with desperate hand her purple raiment, and fastens</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from a lofty beam the noose of hideous death. Soon as</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Latium’s wretched dames knew the blow that had fallen, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">her daughter Lavinia is first to rend yellow hair and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">roseate cheek, and the rest about her ran as wildly: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">palace re-echoes their wail. The miserable story spreads</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">through the town: every heart sinks: there goes the old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">king with garments rent, all confounded by his consort’s <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">death and his city’s ruin: he soils his hoary locks with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">showers of unseemly dust, and oft and oft upbraids himself</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that he embraced not sooner Æneas the Dardan nor</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus, meantime, is plying the war far away on the <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">plain, following here and there a straggler with abated</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">zeal, himself and his steeds alike less buoyant. The air</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wafted to him the confused din, inspiring unknown terror,</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">and on his quickened ears smote the sound of the city’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turmoil and the noise not of joy. “Alas! what is this</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">mighty agony that shakes the walls? what these loud</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shouts pouring from this quarter and that?” So he cries,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and drawing his bridle halts bewildered. His sister, just <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as she stood in guise of Metiscus the driver, guiding car,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">horse, and reins, thus meets his question: “Proceed we</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">still, Turnus, to chase the Trojans, where victory’s dawn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shows us the way: others there are whose hands can</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">stirs up the battle: let us send havoc as cruel among his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Teucrians: so shall your slain be as many and your martial</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">fame as high.” Turnus answered: “Sister, I both</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">chance is there left to give me hope of safety? With my <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">own eyes I saw Murranus die, his giant frame laid low</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by a giant wound: he called me by name, he, than whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I had no dearer friend. Dead, too, is ill-starred Ufens,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all because he would not see me disgraced: his body and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his arms are the Teucrians’ prize. Am I to let the nation’s <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">homes be razed to the ground, the one drop that was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wanting to the cup, and not rather with my own right</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">since the gods above are against me! Yes, I will come</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down to you a stainless spirit, guiltless of that base charge,</div>

  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Scarce had he spoken, when lo! there flies through the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">midst of the foe, on a foaming steed, Saces, with an arrow <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">full in his face: up he spurs, imploring Turnus by name:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">“Turnus, our last hope is in you: have compassion on</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">threatens that he will level in dust and give to destruction</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the Italians’ topmost battlements: even now brands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are flying to the roofs. Every Latian face, every eye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turns to you: the king himself mutters in doubt whom</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">more, your fastest friend the queen is dead by her own</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">blades: you are rolling your car over a field from which <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war has ebbed.” Turnus stood still with silent dull regard,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wildered by the thoughts that crowd on his mind:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">deep shame, grief and madness, frenzy-goaded passion</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and conscious wrath all surging at once. Soon as the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shadows parted and light came back to his intelligence, <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he darted his blazing eyes cityward with restless vehemence,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and looked back from his car to the wide-stretching</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">town. Lo! there was a cone of fire spreading from story</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to story and flaring to heaven: the flame was devouring</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the turret which he had built himself of planks welded <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">together, put wheels beneath it, and furnished it with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lofty bridges. “Fate is too strong for me, sister, too</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strong: hold me back no longer: we needs must follow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">where Heaven and cruel Fortune are calling us. Yes, I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>will</i> meet Æneas: I will endure the full bitterness of <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">death: no more, my love, shall you see me disgraced:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suffer me first to have my hour of madness.” He said,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and in a moment leapt to the ground, rushes on through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">foes, through javelins, leaves his sister to her sorrow, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dashes at full speed through the intervening ranks. Even <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as from a mountain’s top down comes a rock headlong,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">torn off by the wind, or washed down by vehement rain,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or loosened by the lapse of creeping years; down the steep</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it crashes with giant impulse, that reckless stone, bounding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the ground and rolling along with it trees, herds, <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and men: so, dashing the ranks apart, rushes Turnus to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the city walls, where the earth is wet with plashy blood,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and the gale hurtles with spears: he beckons with his</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand, and cries with a mighty voice: “Have done, ye</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulians! ye Latians, hold back your darts! whatever</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fortune brings she brings to me: ’tis juster far that I in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your stead should singly expiate the treaty’s breach and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">try the issue of the steel.” All at the word part from the <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">midst, and leave him a clear space.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But father Æneas, hearing Turnus’ name, quits his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hold on the walls and the battlements that crown them,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flings delay to the winds and breaks off the work of war,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">steps high in triumph, and makes his arms peal dread <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">thunder: vast as Athos, vast as Eryx, vast as father</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apennine himself, when he roars with his quivering holms<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and lifts his snowy crest exultingly to the sky. All turn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their eyes with eager contention. Rutulians, Trojans, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Italians, those alike who were manning the towers and <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">those whose battering-rams were assailing the foundations.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">All unbrace their armour. Latinus himself stands amazed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to see two men so mighty, born in climes so distant each</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from each, thus met together to try the steel’s issue. At</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">once, when a space is cleared on the plain, first hurling <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their spears, they advance with swift onset, and dash into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the combat with shield and ringing harness. Earth groans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">beneath them; their swords hail blow on blow: chance</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and valour mingle pell-mell. As when on mighty Sila or</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Taburnus’ summit two bulls, lowering their brows for <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">combat, engage fiercely: the herdsmen retreat in dread:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the cattle all stand dumb with terror, the heifers wait in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">suspense who is to be the monarch of the woodland,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whom the herds are to follow henceforth: they each in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turn give furious blows, push and lodge their horns, and <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bathe neck and shoulders with streams of blood: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sound makes the forest bellow again: with no less fury</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas the Trojan, and the Daunian chief clash shield on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shield: the enormous din fills the firmament. Jupiter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">himself holds aloft his scales poised and level, and lays <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">therein the destinies of the two, to see whom the struggle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">dooms, and whose the weight that death bears down.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forth darts Turnus, deeming it safe, rises with his whole</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">frame on the uplifted sword, and strikes, Trojans and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">eager Latians shout aloud: both armies gaze expectant.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the faithless sword snaps in twain and fails its fiery</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lord midway in the stroke, unless flight should come to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his aid. Off he flies swifter than the wind, seeing an unknown <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hilt in his defenceless hand. Men say that in his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">headlong haste, when first he was mounting the car harnessed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for battle, he left behind his father’s falchion and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">snatched up the steel of Metiscus, his charioteer: so long</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as the Teucrians fled straggling before him, the weapon <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">did good service; soon as it came to the divine Vulcanian</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">armour, the mortal blade, like brittle ice, flew asunder at</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the stroke: the fragments sparkle on the yellow sand.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So now in his distraction Turnus flies here and there</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">over the plain, weaving vague circles in this place and in <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that: for the Trojans have closed in circle about him,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and here is a spreading marsh, there lofty ramparts to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">bar the way.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor is Æneas wanting, though at times the arrow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wound slackens his knees and robs them of their power <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to run: no, he follows on, and presses upon the flier foot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for foot: as when a hound has got a stag pent in by a</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">river, or hedged about by the terror of crimson plumage,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and chases him running and barking: the stag, frighted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">by the snare and the steep bank, doubles a thousand times: <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the keen Umbrian clings open-mouthed to his skirts, all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">but seizes him, and as though in act to seize, snaps his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">teeth, and is baffled to find nothing in their gripe. Then,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">if ever, uprises a shout, echoing along bank and marsh,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and heaven rings again with the noise. Turnus, even as <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">he flies, calls fiercely on the Rutulians, addressing by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">name, and clamors for his well-known sword. Æneas,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for his part, threatens death and instant destruction,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should any come near, and terrifies his trembling foes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">swearing that he will raze their city to the ground, and <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">presses on in spite of his wound. Five times they circle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">round, five times they retrace the circle: for no trivial</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prize is at stake, no guerdon of a game: the contest is</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">for Turnus’ life, for his very heart’s blood. It chanced</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that there had stood there a wild olive with its bitter</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">leaves, sacred to Faunus, a tree in old days reverenced by</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seamen, where when saved from ocean they used to fasten</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their offerings to the Laurentian god and hang up their <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">votive garments: but the unrespecting Trojans had lately</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lopped the hallowed trunk, that the lists might be clear</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for combat. There was lodged Æneas’ spear: thither its</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">force had carried it, and was now holding it fast in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">unyielding root. The Dardan chief bent over it, fain to <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wrench forth the steel that his weapon may catch whom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his foot cannot overtake. Then cried Turnus in the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">moment of frenzied agony: “Have mercy, I conjure thee,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">good Faunus, and thou, most gracious earth, hold fast</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the steel if I have ever reverenced your sanctities, which <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas’ crew for their part have caused battle to desecrate.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He said, nor were his vows unanswered by heavenly aid.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hard as he struggled, long as he lingered over the stubborn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stock, by no force could Æneas make the wood unclose</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">its fangs. While he strains with keen insistence, the <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Daunian goddess, resuming the guise of charioteer Metiscus,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">runs forward and restores to her brother his sword.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Then Venus, resenting the freedom taken by the presumptuous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nymph, came nigh, and plucks the weapon</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the depth of the root. And now towering high, <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with restored weapons and recruited force, this in strong</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">reliance on his sword, that fiercely waving his spear tall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as he, the two stand front to front in the breath-draining</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">conflict of war.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Meanwhile the king of almighty Olympus accosts Juno, <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as from a golden cloud she gazes on the battle: “Where</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">stars. What plan you now? what hope keeps you seated</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">could Juturna have apart from you?—should receive</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">back his lost sword and the vanquished should feel new</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">forces? At length have done, and let my prayers bow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">your will. Let this mighty sorrow cease to devour you</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in silence: let me hear sounds of sullen disquiet less often <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from your lovely lips. The barrier has been reached.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To toss the Trojans over land and sea, to kindle an unhallowed</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">all further action I forbid.” So spake Jupiter: and so in <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">return Saturn’s daughter with downcast look: “Even</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">because I knew, great Jove, that such was your pleasure,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">armed with firebrands, I should stand in the very</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">line of battle, and force the Teucrians into the hands of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their foes. As for Juturna, I counselled her, I own, to</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">succour her wretched brother, and warranted an unusual</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">the sake of Latium, for the dignity of your own people:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">when at last peace shall be ratified with a happy bridal,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">for happy let it be: when bonds of treaty shall be knit</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">at last, let it not be thy will that the native Latians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">should change their ancient name, become Trojans or <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">take the Teucrian style: let not them alter their language</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">or their garb. Let there be Latium still: let there be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">centuries of Alban kings: let there be a Roman stock,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strong with the strength of Italian manhood: but let</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Troy be fallen as she is, name and nation alike.” The <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Father of men and nature answered with a smile: “Aye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you are Jove’s own sister, the other branch of Saturn’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">line; such billows of passion surge in your bosom! but</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">come,—let this ineffectual frenzy give way: I grant your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wish, and submit myself in willing obedience. The</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonians shall keep their native tongue, their native</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">customs: the name shall remain as it is: the Teucrians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shall merge in the nation they join—that and no more: <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">their rites and worship shall be my gift: all shall be Latians</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and speak the Latian tongue. The race that shall arise</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from this admixture of Ausonian blood shall transcend in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">piety earth and heaven itself, nor shall any nation pay</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">you such honours as they.” Juno nodded assent, and <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">turned her sullenness to pleasure; meanwhile she departs</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">from the sky, and quits the cloud where she sat.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">This done, the sire meditates a further resolve, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">prepares to part Juturna from her brother’s side. There</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">are two fiends known as the Furies, whom with Tartarean <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Megæra dismal Night brought forth at one and the same</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">birth, wreathing them alike with coiling serpents, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">equipping them with wings that fan the air. They are</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">seen beside Jove’s throne, at the threshold of his angry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sovereignty, goading frail mortality with stings of terror, <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">oft as the monarch of the gods girds himself to send forth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">disease and frightful death, or appals guilty towns with</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">war. One of these Jove sped with haste from heaven’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">summit, and bade her confront Juturna in token of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">will. Forth she flies, borne earthward on the blast of a <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">whirlwind. Swift as the arrow from the string cleaves</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the cloud, sent forth by Parthian—Parthian or Cydonian—tipped</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with fell poison’s gall, the dealer of a wound</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">incurable, and skims the flying vapours hurtling and unforeseen,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">so went the Daughter of Night and made her <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">way to earth. Soon as she sees the forces of Troy and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the army of Turnus, she huddles herself suddenly into the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shape of a puny bird, which oft on tombstone or lonely</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">roof sitting by night screams restlessly through the gloom;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">in this disguise the fiend again and again flies flapping in <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turnus’ face, and beats with her wings on his shield. A</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">strange chilly terror unknits his frame, his hair stands</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">shudderingly erect, and his utterance cleaves to his jaws.</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">But when Juturna knew from far the rustling of those</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fury pinions, she rends, hapless maid, her dishevelled</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tresses, marring, in all a sister’s agony, her face with her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">nails, her breast with her clenched hands: “What now,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">my Turnus, can your sister avail? what more remains for <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">an obdurate wretch like me? by what expedient can I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">lengthen your span? can I face a portent like this? At</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">last, at last I quit the field. Cease to appal my fluttering</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soul, ye birds of ill omen: I know the flapping of your</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wings and its deathful noise; nor fail I to read great <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Jove’s tyrannic will. Is this his recompense for lost virginity?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">why gave he me life to last for ever? why was</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the law of death annulled? else might I end this moment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the tale of my sorrows, and travel to the shades hand in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand with my poor brother. Can immortality, can aught <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that I have to boast give me joy without him? Oh, that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">earth would but yawn deep enough, and send me down,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">goddess though I be, to the powers of the grave!” So</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">saying, she shrouded her head in her azure robe, with many</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a groan, and vanished beneath the river of her deity. <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas presses on, front to front, shaking his massy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tree-like spear, and thus speaks in the fierceness of his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spirit: “What is to be the next delay? why does Turnus</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">still hang back? ours is no contest of speed, but of stern</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">soldiership, hand to hand. Take all disguises you can; <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">muster all your powers of courage or of skill: mount on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">wing, if you list, to the stars aloft, or hide in the cavernous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">depth of earth.” Shaking his head, he replied: “I quail</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not at your fiery words, insulting foe: it is Heaven that</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">makes me quail, and Jove my enemy.” No more he <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">spoke: but, sweeping his eyes round, espies a huge stone,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">a stone ancient and huge, which chanced to be lying on</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the plain, set as some field’s boundary, to forefend disputes</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of ownership: scarce could twelve picked men lift</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">it on their shoulders, such puny frames as earth produces <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">now-a-days: he caught it up with hurried grasp and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">flung it at his foe, rising as he threw, and running rapidly,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as hero might. And yet all the while he knows not that</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">he is running or moving, lifting up or stirring the enormous</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">stone: his knees totter under him, and his blood</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chills and freezes: and so the mass from the warrior’s</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hand, whirled through the empty void, passed not through</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">all the space between nor carried home the blow. Even <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">as in dreams, at night, when heavy slumber has weighed</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">down the eyes, we seem vainly wishing to make eager</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">progress forward and midway in the effort fail helplessly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our tongue has no power, our wonted strength stands not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our frames in stead, nor do words or utterance come at <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">our call: so it is with Turnus: whatever means his valour</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">tries, the fell fiend bars them of their issue. And now</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">confused images whirl through his brain: he looks to his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Rutulians and to the city, and falters with dread, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">quails at the threatening spear: how to escape he knows <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">not, nor how to front the foe, nor sees he anywhere his</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">car or the sister who drives it.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Full in that shrinking face Æneas shakes his fatal</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">weapon, taking aim with his eye, and with an effort of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his whole frame hurls it forth. Never stone flung from <span class="linenum">20</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">engine of siege roars so loud, never peal so rending follows</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the thunderbolt. On flies the spear like dark whirlwind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">with fell destruction on its wing, pierces the edge of the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">corslet, and the outermost circle of the seven-fold shield,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and with a rush cleaves through the thigh. Down with <span class="linenum">25</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his knee doubled under him comes Turnus to earth, all</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">his length prostrated by the blow. Up start the Rutulians,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaning as one man: the whole mountain round</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">rebellows, and the depths of the forest send back the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">sound far and wide. He in lowly suppliance lifts up eye <span class="linenum">30</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and entreating hand: “It is my due,” he cries, “and I</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">ask not to be spared it: take what fortune gives you.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet, if you <i>can</i> feel for a parent’s misery—your father,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Anchises was once in like plight—have mercy on Daunus’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">hoary hairs, and let me, or if you choose my breathless <span class="linenum">35</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">body, be restored to my kin. You are conqueror: the</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ausonians have seen my conquered hands outstretched:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the royal bride is yours: let hatred be pressed no further.”</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">Æneas stood still, a fiery warrior, his eyes rolling, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">checked his hand: and those suppliant words were working</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">more and more on his faltering purpose, when, alas!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the ill-starred belt was seen high on the shoulder, and</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">light flashed from the well-known studs—the belt of <span class="linenum">5</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">young Pallas, whom Turnus conquered and struck down</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">to earth, and bore on his breast the badge of triumphant</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">enmity. Soon as his eyes caught the spoil and drank in</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the recollection of that cruel grief, kindled into madness</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and terrible in his wrath: “What, with my friend’s <span class="linenum">10</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">trophies upon you, would you escape my hand? It is</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Pallas, Pallas, who with this blow makes you his victim,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and gluts his vengeance with your accursed blood.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With these words, fierce as flame, he plunged the steel into</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">the breast that lay before him. That other’s frame grows <span class="linenum">15</span></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">chill and motionless, and the soul,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> resenting its lot, flies</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">groaningly to the shades.</div>

artists of the early time called themselves Dædalides, or
followers of Dædalus. One is reminded of the tale of Jacob
with his “household” meeting Esau with his “household.”
Indeed, the Romans themselves were sometimes called
Romulides, followers of Romulus.</p>

They say, look how many feathers she hath, so many eyes
she hath underneath; so many tongues; so many voices;
she pricks up so many ears. This is a flourish; there follow
excellent parables; as that she gathereth strength in going;
that she goeth upon the ground, and yet hideth her head in
the clouds, that in the day-time she sitteth in a watch-tower,
and flieth most by night; that she mingleth things done<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A recent writer has reminded us that dreams after midnight
were accounted true both by the Greeks and the Romans.
Hence he concluded that Virgil, in making Æneas issue by the
gate of false dreams, is indicating that Æneas comes forth from
the underworld before midnight. As to the time of Æneas’
stay in the lower world see lines 255, 535-539. He is in the
land of the shades from dawn until nearly midnight.”—<span class="smcap">Knapp.</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By those who think this book a symbolic exhibition of certain
mysteries, the legend of the Gate, with the dismissal of
Æneas from the ivory one, is considered a warning that the
language may not be taken literally, or understood except by
the initiated.”—<span class="smcap">Greenough.</span></p>

<p>“Anchises conducts Æneas and the Sibyl to the ivory gate
as the one which affords the easiest and quickest ascent to the

129, would have been a work of great labor.”—<span class="smcap">Frieze.</span></p>
